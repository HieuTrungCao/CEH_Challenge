D,D,"sam , a web developer , was instructed to incorporate a hybrid encryption software program into a web application to secure email messages . sam used an encryption software , which is a free implementation of the openpgp standard that uses both symmetric-key cryptography and asymmetric-key cryptography for improved speed and secure key exchange . what is the encryption software employed by sam for securing the email messages ? a. pgp b. s/mime c. smtp d. gpg","the correct answer is d. gpg . gpg ( gnu privacy guard ) is a free implementation of the openpgp standard , which is a hybrid encryption software program that uses both symmetric-key cryptography and asymmetric-key cryptography for improved speed and secure key exchange . gpg is commonly used to encrypt and decrypt emails , as well as other types of data . pgp ( pretty good privacy ) is also a popular encryption software that uses the openpgp standard , but it is not free . s/mime ( secure/multipurpose internet mail extensions ) is a standard for encrypting and decrypting email messages , but it does not use the openpgp standard and is not a hybrid encryption software . smtp ( simple mail transfer protocol ) is a protocol for sending and receiving email messages , but it is not an encryption software . so , sam is likely using gpg ( gnu privacy guard ) for securing the email messages ."
D,D,which of the following is assured by the use of a hash ? a. authentication b . confidentiality c. availability d. integrity,"the correct answer is d. integrity . a hash is a one-way function that takes input data of any size and produces a fixed-size output , known as a hash value or digest . the use of a hash function provides several security benefits , including : 1 . data integrity : a hash ensures that the data has not been altered or tampered with . if the hash value changes , it indicates that the data has been modified . 2 . non-repudiation : a hash allows the sender to prove that they sent the data without being able to deny it . 3 . data authenticity : a hash can be used to verify the authenticity of the data by comparing the hash value of the data with a known hash value . while a hash can provide some level of integrity , it does not provide the following : * authentication ( a ) : a hash alone can not be used to authenticate the sender or the data , but it can be used in combination with other authentication mechanisms . * confidentiality ( b ) : a hash is a publicly available function , so it does not provide confidentiality . * availability ( c ) : a hash does not provide availability , as it does not ensure that the data will be accessible or usable . therefore , the correct answer is d. integrity ."
C,C,what is not a pci compliance recommendation ? a . use a firewall between the public network and the payment card data . b . use encryption to protect all transmission of card holder data over any public network . c. rotate employees handling credit card transactions on a yearly basis to different departments . d. limit access to card holder data to as few individuals as possible .,"the correct answer is c. rotate employees handling credit card transactions on a yearly basis to different departments . rotating employees handling credit card transactions to different departments is not a recommended practice for pci compliance . pci dss requires that access to card holder data be limited to as few individuals as necessary , but it does not recommend rotating employees on a regular basis . the other options are all pci compliance recommendations : a . using a firewall between the public network and the payment card data is a recommended practice to protect against unauthorized access . b . using encryption to protect all transmission of card holder data over any public network is a recommended practice to protect against eavesdropping and tampering . d. limiting access to card holder data to as few individuals as possible is a recommended practice to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches ."
F,E,what is the proper response for a null scan if the port is closed ? a. syn b. ack c. fin d. psh e. rst f. no response,"the correct answer is f. no response . when a null scan is performed on a closed port , the operating system responds by not sending any data . the null scan is essentially sending a `` no response '' signal , indicating that the port is closed . the other options are not correct : a. syn ( synchronous connection establishment ) is a response to an incoming connection request , not a response to a null scan . b. ack ( acknowledgment ) is a response to data received , not a response to a null scan . c. fin ( finish ) is a response to a connection termination request , not a response to a null scan . d. psh ( push ) is a response to data being pushed , not a response to a null scan . e. rst ( reset ) is a response to an invalid connection attempt , but it 's not the typical response to a null scan . a null scan is designed to test if a port is closed by sending no data and seeing if the operating system responds with no data ."
D,D,what kind of detection techniques is being used in antivirus software that identifies malware by collecting data from multiple protected systems and instead of analyzing files locally it ? s made on the provider ? s environment ? a. behavioral based b. heuristics based c. honeypot based d. cloud based,"the detection technique being described in the question is a `` cloud-based '' detection technique . in cloud-based detection , antivirus software collects data from multiple protected systems and analyzes it in a provider 's environment , rather than on the local system itself . this approach allows for more efficient and effective malware detection , as it leverages the collective power of multiple systems and the expertise of the provider 's team . here 's why the other options do n't match : * behavioral-based ( a ) detection focuses on observing the behavior of the malware on a local system , rather than analyzing it in a cloud environment . * heuristics-based ( b ) detection uses rules and algorithms to identify malware , but does n't necessarily involve cloud-based analysis . * honeypot-based ( c ) detection involves setting up a decoy system to attract and detect malware , but does n't necessarily involve cloud-based analysis . so , the correct answer is d. cloud-based ."
A,A,which type of security feature stops vehicles from crashing through the doors of a building ? a. bollards b. receptionist c. mantrap d. turnstile,"the correct answer is c. mantrap . a mantrap is a security feature that consists of two doors , one leading into a small room or area , and another that leads out . when a vehicle tries to crash through the doors , the inner door closes , trapping the vehicle inside and preventing it from reaching the outer door . the outer door can then be locked , preventing further access . bollards are metal or concrete barriers used to block or restrict access to an area , but they do not prevent vehicles from crashing through doors . a receptionist is a person who greets and handles visitors at a building , but they do not have any physical security features . a turnstile is a device used to control the flow of people into or out of a restricted area , but it does not prevent vehicles from crashing through doors ."

'' cryptcat is a tool that can be used to encrypt and decrypt outgoing traffic from a compromised server . it works by using the ssl/tls protocol to encrypt the traffic , making it difficult for intrusion detection systems ( ids ) to detect and flag it as malicious . here 's why the other options are not the best approaches : a . `` use alternate data streams to hide the outgoing packets from this server . '' - alternate data streams ( ads ) are a feature of the ntfs file system that allows a file to have multiple streams . while ads can be used to hide files from the operating system , it is not a reliable method to evade ids systems . b . `` use http so that all traffic can be routed vis a browser , thus evading the internal intrusion detection systems . '' - while using http to route traffic through a browser can make it more difficult to detect , it is not a foolproof method . ids systems can be configured to detect http traffic , and a malicious actor could still use other protocols ( such as https or ssh ) to evade detection . d. `` install and use telnet to encrypt all outgoing traffic from this server . '' - telnet is a protocol that transmits data in plaintext , and using it to encrypt outgoing traffic would actually make it more detectable . ids systems can flag telnet traffic as suspicious , and encrypting it would only make it easier to detect . in summary , installing and using cryptcat to encrypt outgoing packets from a compromised server is the best approach to evade ids systems and maintain network activity undetected ."
