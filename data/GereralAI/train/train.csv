C,C,"a security team is implementing various security controls across the organization . after considering several configurations and applications , a final agreed-on set of security controls is put into place ; however , not all risks are mitigated by the controls . of the following , which is the next best step ? a . continue applying controls until all risk is eliminated . b . ignore any remaining risk as “ best effort controlled. ” c. ensure that any remaining risk is residual or low and accept the risk . d. remove all controls .","the correct answer is c. remember at the beginning of this chapter when i said the process of elimination may be your best bet in some cases ? well , even if you aren ’ t well-versed in risk management and security control efforts , you could narrow this down to the correct answer . it is impossible to remove all risk from any system and still have it usable . i ’ m certain there are exceptions to this rule ( maybe super-secret machines in underground vaults buried deep within the earth , running on geothermal-powered batteries , without any network access at all and controlled by a single operator who hasn ’ t seen daylight in many years ) , but in general the goal of security teams has always been to reduce risk to an acceptable level ."
A,A,a certified ethical hacker ( ceh ) follows a specific methodology for testing a system . which step comes after footprinting in the ceh methodology ? a. scanning b. enumeration c. reconnaissance d. application attack,"the correct answer is a. ceh methodology is laid out this way : reconnaissance ( footprinting ) , scanning and enumeration , gaining access , escalating privileges , maintaining access , and covering tracks . while you may be groaning about scanning and enumeration both appearing as answers , they ’ re placed here in this way on purpose . this exam is not only testing your rote memorization of the methodology but also how the methodology actually works . remember , after scoping out the recon on your target , your next step is to scan it . after all , you have to know what targets are there first before enumerating information about them ."
B,B,your organization is planning for the future and is identifying the systems and processes critical for their continued operation . which of the following best describes this effort ? a. bcp b. bia c. drp d. ale,"the correct answer is b . a business impact analysis ( bia ) best matches this description . in a bia , the organization looks at all the systems and processes in use and determines which ones are absolutely critical to continued operation . additionally , the assessor ( the person or company conducting the analysis ) will look at all the existing security architecture and make an evaluation on the likelihood of any system or resource being compromised . part of this is assigning values to systems and services , determining the maximum tolerable downtime ( mtd ) for any , and identifying any overlooked vulnerabilities ."
A,A,"which incident response ( ir ) phase is responsible for setting rules , identifying the workforce and roles , and creating backup and test plans for the organization ? a . preparation b . identification c. containment d. recovery","the correct answer is a . so even if you weren ’ t aware of incident response phases , this one should ’ ve been a rather easy guess . in the preparation phase , your ir ( incident response ) team should be preparing for an incident . preparation includes lots of things—some of which are mentioned here . but virtually anything you can think of that does not involve actions taken during the incident belongs here . training , exercises , and policies are all examples . as an aside , ir phases can be different depending on whom you ask and what the moon phase is , but generally ir is broken down into six phases : preparation , identification , containment , eradication , recovery , and lessons learned . preparation we already covered . identification refers to the steps taken to verify it ’ s actually an incident , and all the information surrounding that—source , destination ( s ) , exploit used , malware used , and so on . containment is the step used to cordon off the infected system ( s ) and prevent any further spread of infection or attack . eradication refers to steps taken to remove the malware ( or other attack-related residuals , such as backdoors ) . recovery involves the steps taken to rebuild and restore the system ( s ) and network to pre-attack status ( with better security , i might add ) . finally , lessons learned is exactly what it sounds like , and it should feed right back into your organization ’ s preparation phase ."
B,B,"you ’ ve been hired as part of a pen test team . during the brief , you learn the client wants the pen test attack to simulate a normal user who finds ways to elevate privileges and create attacks . which test type does the client want ? a . white box b . gray box c. black box d. hybrid","the correct answer is b . a gray-box test is designed to replicate an inside attacker . otherwise known as the partial knowledge attack ( don ’ t forget this term ) , the idea is to simulate a user on the inside who might know a little about the network , directory structure , and other resources in your enterprise . you ’ ll probably find this one to be the most enlightening attack in out-briefing your clients in the real world—it ’ s amazing what you can get to when you ’ re a trusted , inside user . as an aside , you ’ ll often find in the real world that gray-box testing can also refer to a test where any inside information is given to a pen tester—you don ’ t necessarily need to be a fully knowledgeable inside user . in other words , if you have usable information handed to you about your client , you ’ re performing gray-box testing ."
A,A,which of the following is defined as ensuring the enforcement of organizational security policy does not rely on voluntary user compliance by assigning sensitivity labels on information and comparing this to the level of security a user is operating at ? a . mandatory access control b . authorized access control c. role-based access control d. discretionary access control,"the correct answer is a . access control is defined as the selective restraint of access to a resource , and there are several overall mechanisms to accomplish this goal . mandatory access control ( mac ) is one type that constrains the ability of a subject to access or perform an operation on an object by assigning and comparing “ sensitivity labels. ” suppose a person ( or a process ) attempts to access or edit a file . with mac , a label is placed on the file indicating its security level . if the entity attempting to access it does not have that level , or higher , then access is denied . with mandatory access control , security is centrally controlled by a security policy administrator , and users do not have the ability to override security settings . this should not be confused with role-based access control ( rbac ) systems , which may actually use mac to get the job done . the difference is in whether the information itself has a labeled description or whether the person accessing it has their own label . for example , in a classified area , the information classified as top secret will have a label on it identifying it as such , while you , as an auditor , will have your own clearance and need-to-know label allowing you to access certain information . mac is a property of an object ; rbac is a property of someone accessing an object ."
C,C,"which of the following statements is true regarding the tcp three-way handshake ? a . the recipient sets the initial sequence number in the second step . b . the sender sets the initial sequence number in the third step . c. when accepting the communications request , the recipient responds with an acknowledgement and a randomly generated sequence number in the second step . d. when accepting the communications request , the recipient responds with an acknowledgement and a randomly generated sequence number in the third step .","the correct answer is c. the three-way handshake will definitely show up on your exam , and in much trickier wording than this . it ’ s easy enough to memorize “ syn , syn/ack , ack , ” but you ’ ll need more than that for the exam . in step 1 , the host sends a segment to the server , indicating it wants to open a communications session . inside this segment , the host turns on the syn flag and sets an initial sequence number ( any random 32-bit number ) . when the recipient gets the segment , it crafts a segment in response to let the host know it ’ s open and ready for the communications session . it does this by turning on the syn and ack flags , acknowledging the initial sequence number by incrementing it , and adding its own unique sequence number . then , when the host gets this response back , it sends one more segment before the comm channel opens . in this segment , it sets the ack flag and acknowledges the other ’ s sequence number by incrementing it . for example , suppose host a is trying to open a channel with server b . in this example , host a likes the sequence number 2000 , while server b likes 5000 . the first segment would look like this : syn=1 , ack=0 , isn=2000 . the response segment would look like this : syn=1 , ack=1 , isn=5000 , ack no=2001 . the third and final segment would appear this way : syn=0 , ack=1 , seq no=2001 , ack no=5001 ."
D,D,"your network contains certain servers that typically fail once every five years . the total cost of one of these servers is $ 1000 . server technicians are paid $ 40 per hour , and a typical replacement requires two hours . ten employees , earning an average of $ 20 per hour , rely on these servers , and even one of them going down puts the whole group in a wait state until it ’ s brought back up . which of the following represents the aro for a server ? a . $ 296 b . $ 1480 c. $ 1000 d. 0.20","the correct answer is d. when performing business impact analysis ( or any other value analysis for that matter ) , the annualized loss expectancy ( ale ) is an important measurement for every asset . to compute the ale , multiply the annualized rate of occurrence ( aro ) by the single loss expectancy ( sle ) . the aro is the frequency at which a failure occurs on an annual basis . in this example , servers fail once every five years , so the aro would be 1 failure / 5 years = 20 percent ."
A,A,"an ethical hacker is given no prior knowledge of the network and has a specific framework in which to work . the agreement specifies boundaries , nondisclosure agreements , and a completion date definition . which of the following statements is true ? a . a white hat is attempting a black-box test . b . a white hat is attempting a white-box test . c. a black hat is attempting a black-box test . d. a black hat is attempting a gray-box test .","the correct answer is a. i love these types of questions . not only is this a two-for-one question , but it involves identical but confusing descriptors , causing all sorts of havoc . the answer to attacking such questions—and you will see them , by the way—is to take each section one at a time . start with what kind of hacker he is . he ’ s hired under a specific agreement , with full knowledge and consent of the target , thus making him a white hat . that eliminates c and d right off the bat . second , to address what kind of test he ’ s performing , simply look at what he knows about the system . in this instance , he has no prior knowledge at all ( apart from the agreement ) , thus making it a black-box test ."
A,A,which of the following is a detective control ? a . audit trail b. conops c. procedure d. smartcard authentication e. process,"the correct answer is a . a detective control is an effort used to identify problems , errors , or ( in the case of post-attack discovery ) cause or evidence of an exploited vulnerability—and an audit log or trail is a perfect example . ideally , detective controls should be in place and working such that errors can be corrected as quickly as possible . many compliance laws and standards ( the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 is one example ) mandate the use of detective controls ."
B,B,"as part of a pen test on a u.s. government system , you discover files containing social security numbers and other sensitive personally identifiable information ( pii ) . you are asked about controls placed on the dissemination of this information . which of the following acts should you check ? a. fisma b. privacy act c. patriot act d. freedom of information act","the correct answer is b . the privacy act of 1974 protects information of a personal nature , including social security numbers . the privacy act defines exactly what “ personal information ” is , and it states that government agencies can not disclose any personal information about an individual without that person ’ s consent . it also lists 12 exemptions for the release of this information ( for example , information that is part of a law enforcement issue may be released ) . in other questions you see , keep in mind that the privacy act generally will define the information that is not available to you during and after a test . dissemination and storage of private information needs to be closely controlled to keep you out of hot water . as a side note , how you obtain pii is oftentimes just as important as how you protect it once discovered . in your real-world adventures , keep the wiretap act ( 18 u.s. code chapter 119—wire and electronic communications interception and interception of oral communications ) and others like it in mind ."
B,B,in which step of the cyber kill chain methodology would an adversary create a deliverable malicious payload ? a . command and control ( c2 ) b. weaponization c. installation d. exploitation,"the correct answer is b . originally developed from a military model by lockheed martin ( url lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html ) seeking to quantify how to identify , prepare to attack , engage , and destroy the cyber enemy target , the cyber kill chain is a methodology for tracing the stages of a cyberattack . covering everything from early reconnaissance to data exfiltration ( or worse ) , it has evolved to help security professionals better understand and combat adversarial efforts . the methodology includes seven steps—reconnaissance , weaponization , delivery , exploitation , installation , command and control ( c2 ) , and actions on objectives—detailing an attack from inception to closure . in the weaponization stage , adversaries create the deliverable malicious payload using an exploit , and in the next stage , delivery , they send it merrily along the way ."
C,C,an organization ’ s leadership is concerned about social engineering and hires a company to provide training for all employees . how is the organization handling the risk associated with social engineering ? a . they are accepting the risk . b . they are avoiding the risk . c. they are mitigating the risk . d. they are transferring the risk .,"the correct answer is c. when it comes to risks , there are four different methods of attempting to deal with them . in risk mitigation , steps are taken to reduce the chance that the risk even will occur , and in this example that ’ s exactly what ’ s happening . training on social engineering should help reduce the likelihood an employee will fall victim ( real-life concerns on this notwithstanding—we are talking about test questions here ) ."
B,B,in which phase of the ethical hacking methodology would a hacker be expected to discover available targets on a network ? a. reconnaissance b. scanning and enumeration c. gaining access d. maintaining access e. covering tracks,"the correct answer is b . the scanning and enumeration phase is where you ’ ll use things such as ping sweeps to discover available targets on the network . this step occurs after reconnaissance . in this step , tools and techniques are actively applied to information gathered during recon to obtain more in-depth information on the targets . for example , reconnaissance may show a network subnet to have 500 or so machines connected inside a single building , whereas scanning and enumeration would discover which ones are windows machines and which ones are running ftp . as an aside , it ’ s important to remember these phases and definitions are exactly what you ’ ll need to pass your exam , but in the real world , actions and findings don ’ t necessarily fit cleanly into predefined roles and definitions ."
C,C,which of the following was created to protect shareholders and the general public from corporate accounting errors and fraudulent practices as well as to improve the accuracy of corporate disclosures ? a. glba b. hipaa c. sox d. fitara,"the correct answer is c. the sarbanes-oxley act ( sox ; url introduced major changes to the regulation of financial practice and corporate governance in 2002 and is arranged into 11 titles . sox mandated a number of reforms to enhance corporate responsibility , enhance financial disclosures , and combat corporate and accounting fraud , and it created the “ public company accounting oversight board , ” also known as the pcaob , to oversee the activities of the auditing profession ."
B,B,which of the following best defines a logical or technical control ? a . air conditioning b . security tokens c. fire alarms d. security policy,"the correct answer is b . a logical ( or technical ) control is one used for identification , authentication , and authorization . it can be embedded inside an operating system , application , or database management system . a security token ( such as rsa ’ s secureid ) can provide a number that changes on a recurring basis that a user must provide during authentication , or it may provide a built-in number on a usb device that must be attached during authentication . a physical control is something , well , physical in nature , such as a lock or key or maybe a guard ."
D,D,which of the following was created to protect credit card data at rest and in transit in an effort to reduce fraud ? a. tcsec b . common criteria c. iso 27002 d. pci dss,"the correct answer is d. the payment card industry data security standard ( pci dss ) is a security standard for organizations that handle credit cards . a council including american express , jcb , discover , mastercard , and visa developed standards for the protection and transmission of card data to reduce credit card fraud . it ’ s administered by the payment card industry security standards council . validation of compliance is performed annually . the standard is composed of 12 requirements : • requirement 1 : install and maintain firewall configuration to protect data . • requirement 2 : remove vendor-supplied default passwords and other default security features . • requirement 3 : protect stored data . • requirement 4 : encrypt transmission of cardholder data . • requirement 5 : install , use , and update av ( antivirus ) . • requirement 6 : develop secure systems and applications . • requirement 7 : use “ need to know ” as a guideline to restrict access to data . • requirement 8 : assign a unique id to each stakeholder in the process ( with computer access ) . • requirement 9 : restrict any physical access to the data . • requirement 10 : monitor all access to data and network resources holding , transmitting , or protecting it . • requirement 11 : test security procedures and systems regularly . • requirement 12 : create and maintain an information security policy ."
A,A,"as part of the preparation phase for a pen test you are participating in , the client relays their intent to discover security flaws and possible remediation . they seem particularly concerned about internal threats from the user base . which of the following best describes the test type the client is looking for ? a . gray box b . black box c. white hat d. black hat","the correct answer is a . once again , this is a play on words the exam will throw at you . note the question is asking about a test type , not the attacker . reviewing ceh documentation , you ’ ll see there are three types of tests—white , black , and gray—with each designed to test a specific threat . white tests the internal threat of a knowledgeable systems administrator or an otherwise elevated privilege level user . black tests external threats with no knowledge of the target . gray tests the average internal user threat to expose potential security problems inside the network ."
D,D,in which phase of the attack would a hacker set up and configure “ zombie ” machines ? a. reconnaissance b . covering tracks c. gaining access d. maintaining access,"the correct answer is d. zombies are basically machines hackers commandeer to do their work for them . if the attacker is really good , the owners of the zombie machines don ’ t even know their machines have been drafted into the war . there are a bajillion methods for maintaining access on a machine you ’ ve already compromised , and maintaining that access does not necessarily mean the system will be used as a zombie—you could , for example , simply want to check in from time to time to see what new juicy information the user has decided to leave in a file or folder for you , or to check on new logins , credentials , and so on . however , configuring zombie systems definitely belongs in this phase ."
C,C,which of the following should not be included in a security policy ? a . policy exceptions b . details on noncompliance disciplinary actions c. technical details and procedures d. supporting document references,"the correct answer is c. the whole policy/standard/procedure/guideline thing can get confusing sometimes . a policy is a high-level document that doesn ’ t get down and dirty into technical details/specifications and is intended to improve awareness . policies are mandatory , generally short , and easy to understand , providing everyone with the rules of the road . standards are mandatory rules designed to support a policy , and they must include one or more specifications for hardware , software , or behavior . procedures are step- by-step instructions for completing a task . guidelines are not mandatory but rather are recommendations for accomplishing a goal or on how to act in a given situation ."
A,A,"which of the following is best defined as a set of processes used to identify , analyze , prioritize , and resolve security incidents ? a . incident management b . vulnerability management c. change management d. patch management","the correct answer is a . admittedly , this one is fairly easy—or at least it should be . incident management is the process of dealing with incidents and generally always has the same features/ steps—identify the problem or root cause , analyze and research the issue , contain the malicious effort , eradicate the effort , and resolve any damage caused . ecc defines the process as having eight steps : 1 . preparation , 2 . detection and analysis , 3 . classification/prioritization , 4 . notification , 5 . containment , 6 . forensic investigation , 7 . eradication and recovery , and 8 . post-incident activities . the incident response team ( irt ) is charged with handling this process ."
D,D,"during an assessment , your pen test team discovers child porn on a system . which of the following is the appropriate response ? a . continue testing and report findings at the out-brief . b . continue testing but report findings to the business owners . c. cease testing immediately and refuse to continue work for the client . d. cease testing immediately and contact authorities .","the correct answer is d. i hesitated to add this question , for reasons that are obvious and some that aren ’ t , but in the interest of covering everything , i felt i must . first and foremost , in the real world , discovery of something that you think might be illegal activity puts you and your team in a very , very tricky spot . should you accuse fill-in-the-blank of a crime and involve the authorities , you could be setting yourself up for lawsuits and all sorts of trouble . on the other hand , if you ignore it , you might be found complicit , or at the very least negligent . in the real world , the answer is to make sure your scope agreement advises you and the client of your duty regarding potential criminal activity found during the scope of your investigation . no guessing is allowed—it better be iron-clad evidence , obvious to all , or you ’ re in a world of hurt . finally , what potentially illegal activity you discover may determine your response regardless of the roe ( rules of engagement ) . if you discover child porn , you could be guilty of a crime for not reporting it , which isn ’ t necessarily true for many other crimes . for example , if you witness someone breaking into a house across your street , or were performing a pen test and reasonably suspected someone had already compromised the network , you are not compelled by law , in most states , to notify authorities . however , if you witness bodily harm , you likely would be compelled by law in most states . speaking purely academically , it ’ s fairly clear cut and will be so on your exam . in the real world , the true answer is to know the laws regarding your testing very well , and make sure your team has a good lawyer . in this example , however , the choices present make this relatively easy . ecc wants ethical hackers to report any illegal activity they find . period . possession of child porn is a crime no matter what , so again in this particular case , stop your testing and report it to the authorities ."
A,A,"which of the following best describes an intranet zone ? a . a zone with few heavy security restrictions b . a highly secured zone , usually employing vlans and encrypted communication channels c. a controlled buffer network between public and private networks d. a very restricted zone with no users","the correct answer is a . an intranet can be thought of , for testing purposes , as your own happy little networking safe space . it ’ s protected from outside attacks and interference by the dmz and all the layers of security on the outside . internally , you don ’ t assign loads of heavy security restrictions , because , as explained in the security versus usability discussion in the ceh all-in-one exam guide , fifth edition , as security increases , usability and functionality decrease . if your organization ’ s users are on the intranet , you want them as productive as possible , right ?"
"B, D","B, D","a machine in your environment uses an open x-server to allow remote access . the x-server access control is disabled , allowing connections from almost anywhere and with little to no authentication measures . which of the following are true statements regarding this situation ? ( choose all that apply . ) a . an external vulnerability can take advantage of the misconfigured x-server threat . b . an external threat can take advantage of the misconfigured x-server vulnerability . c. an internal vulnerability can take advantage of the misconfigured x-server threat . d. an internal threat can take advantage of the misconfigured x-server vulnerability .","the correct answer is b , d. this is an easy one because all you have to understand are the definitions of threat and vulnerability . a threat is any agent , circumstance , or situation that could potentiality cause harm or loss to an it asset . in this case , the implication is the threat is an individual ( hacker ) either inside or outside the network . a vulnerability is any weakness , such as a software flaw or logic design , that could be exploited by a threat to cause damage to an asset . in both these answers , the vulnerability—the access controls on the x-server are not in place—can be exploited by the threat , whether internal or external ."
B,B,which of the following best describes forensic evidence indicating a potential intrusion or malicious activity ? a. ttp b. ioc c. apt d. abi,"the correct answer is b . an indicator of compromise ( ioc ) describes the little clues and artifacts left behind on a resource that can indicate malicious intrusion or activity . their existence in and of themselves might not mean anything ; however , searching for known iocs in your network can be a valuable security exercise to undertake . iocs can come in many forms , some of which include privileged user activity anomalies , strange dns requests , conflicting port application traffic , unusual registry or system file changes , and suspect web traffic and unusual network activity ."
B,B,which header field is used to reassemble fragmented ip packets ? a. destination address b.ip identification c.don ’ t fragment bit d.tos field,"the correct answer is b . the destination address is used as the address to send messages to . the don ’ t fragment bit is used to tell network devices not to fragment the packet . the type of service ( tos ) field can be used to perform quality of service . the ip identification field is used to identify fragments of the same packet , as they would all have the same ip identification number ."
C,C,"if you were to see the following in a packet capture , what would you expect was happening ? ‘ or 1=1 ; a. cross-site scripting b.command injection c.sql injection d.xml external entity injection","the correct answer is c. a sql injection attack makes use of sql queries , which can include logic that may alter the flow of the application . in the example provided , the intent is to force the result of the sql query to always return a true . it is quoted the way it is to escape the existing query already in place in the application . none of the other attacks use a syntax that looks like the example ."
C,C,what method might you use to successfully get malware onto a mobile device ? a . through the apple store or google play store b.external storage on an android c.third-party app store d.jailbreaking,"the correct answer is c. the apple app store and the google play store are controlled by apple and google . it ’ s not impossible to get malware onto mobile devices that way , but it ’ s very difficult because apps get run through a vetting process . while some android devices will support external storage , it ’ s not an effective way to get malware onto a smartphone or other mobile device . jailbreaking can lead to malware being installed but it ’ s not the means to get malware onto a mobile device . third-party app stores can be a good means to get malware onto mobile devices because some third-party app stores don ’ t vet apps that are submitted ."
B,B,what protocol is used to take a destination ip address and get a packet to a destination on the local network ? a. dhcp b.arp c.dns d.rarp,the correct answer is b. dhcp is used to get ip configuration to endpoints . dns is used to resolve a hostname to an ip address and vice versa . rarp is the reverse address protocol used to take a mac address and resolve it to an ip address . arp is used to resolve an ip address to a mac address . communication on a local network requires the use of a mac address . the ip address is used to get to systems off the local network .
C,C,what would be the result of sending the string aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa into a variable that has been allocated space for 8 bytes ? a. heap spraying b.sql injection c.buffer overflow d.slowloris attack,the correct answer is c. heap spraying uses dynamically allocated space to store attack code . a slowloris attack is used to hold open web server connection buffers . a sql injection will be used to inject sql queries to the database server . a buffer overflow sends more data into the application than space has been allocated for .
B,B,"if you were to see the subnet mask 255.255.248.0 , what cidr notation ( prefix ) would you use to indicate the same thing ? a . /23 b./22 c./21 d./20",the correct answer is b . a /23 network would be 255.255.254.0 . a /22 would be 255.255.252 . a /20 would be 255.255.240.0 . only a /21 would give you a 255.255.248.0 subnet mask .
C,C,what is the primary difference between a worm and a virus ? a . a worm uses polymorphic code b . a virus uses polymorphic code c. a worm can self-propagate d. a virus can self-propagate,"the correct answer is c. both worms and viruses could be written to use polymorphic code , which means they could modify what they look like as they propagate . a worm , though , could self-propagate . it ’ s the one distinction between worms and viruses . viruses require some intervention on the part of the user to propagate and execute ."
A,A,how would you calculate risk ? a. probability * loss b.probability * mitigation factor c. ( loss + mitigation factor ) * ( loss/probability ) d.probability * mitigation factor,the correct answer is a . risk is the probability of the occurrence of an event multiplied by the dollar value of loss . there is no mitigation factor that is quantified so it could be put into a risk ­calculation .
B,B,how does an evil twin attack work ? a. phishing users for credentials b.spoofing an ssid c.changing an ssid d.injecting four-way handshakes,"the correct answer is b . an evil twin attack uses an access point masquerading to be the point of connection for stations trying to connect to a legitimate wireless network . stations reach out to make connections to this access point masquerading as another access point . while you may phish for credentials as part of an evil twin attack , credential phishing is not how evil twin attacks work . ssids don ’ t get changed as part of an evil twin attack , meaning no ssid that exists will become another ssid . injecting four-way handshakes won ’ t do much , since four- way assumes both ends are communicating , so the injection of a full communication stream will get ignored ."
C,C,"in order to remove malware in the network before it gets to the endpoint , you would use which of the following ? a. antivirus b.application layer gateway c.unified threat management appliance d.stateful firewall","the correct answer is c. antivirus solutions are used on endpoints or maybe on email servers . stateful firewalls add in the ability to factor in the state of the connection—new , related , established . an application layer gateway knows about application layer protocols . a unified threat management appliance adds additional capabilities on top of firewall functions , including antivirus ."
A,A,what is the purpose of a security policy ? a . providing high-level guidance on the role of security b.providing specific direction to security workers c.increasing the bottom line of a company d.aligning standards and practices,"the correct answer is a . standards and practices should be derived from a security policy , which is the high- level guidance on the role of security within an organization . security does not generally increase the bottom line of a company . policies are not for providing specific directions , which would be the role of procedures ."
B. Base64 encoding takes non-printable characters and encodes them in a way that they can be rendered in text. Encryption would generally render text unreadable to people. A cryptographic hash is a way of generating a fixed-length value to identify a value. URL encoding takes text and uses hexadecimal values to represent the characters. This is text that has been converted into hexadecimal so they can be used in a URL.,B,what has been done to the following string ? % 3cscript % 3ealert ( ‘ wubble ’ ),the correct answer is % 3c/ script % 3e a. base64 encoding b. url encoding c. encryption d. cryptographic hashing
B,B,what would you get from running the command dig ns domain.com ? a . mail exchanger records for domain.com b.name server records for domain.com c.caching name server for domain.com d.ip address for the hostname ns,"the correct answer is b . mail exchanger records would be identified as mx records . a name server record is identified with the tag ns . while an enterprise may have one or even several caching name servers , the caching name server wouldn ’ t be said to belong to the domain since it doesn ’ t have any domain identification associated with it ."
C,C,what technique would you ideally use to get all of the hostnames associated with a domain ? a. dns query b.zone copy c.zone transfer d.recursive request,"the correct answer is c. a dns query can be used to identify an ip address from a hostname or vice versa . you could potentially use a brute-force technique to identify hostnames , though you may not get everything using that method . a recursive request is common from a caching server to get an authoritative response . the term for getting all the contents of the zone is a zone transfer ."
A,A,"if you were to notice operating system commands inside a dns request while looking at a packet capture , what might you be looking at ? a. tunneling attack b.dns amplification c.dns recursion d.xml entity injection",the correct answer is a. tunneling attacks can be used to hide one protocol inside another . this may be used to send operating system commands using a tunnel system . a dns amplification attack is where a small dns request results in much larger responses sent to the target . dns recur- sion is used to look up information from dns servers . an xml entity injection attack is a web-based attack and wouldn ’ t be found inside a dns request .
D,D,what would be the purpose of running a ping sweep ? a . you want to identify responsive hosts without a port scan . b.you want to use something that is light on network traffic . c.you want to use a protocol that may be allowed through the firewall . d.all of the above .,"the correct answer is d. there may be several reasons for performing a ping sweep . you likely want to identify responsive hosts on the network segment you are targeting . you may not , though , want to use a full port scan . icmp is a lightweight protocol and there is a chance it will be allowed through the firewall , since it ’ s used for troubleshooting and diagnostics ."

D,D,"if you were on a client engagement and discovered that you left an external hard drive with essential data on it at home , which security principle would you be violating ? a . confidentiality b.integrity c.non-repudiation d.availability",the correct answer is d. confidentiality is about making sure secrets are kept secret . integrity makes sure that data isn ’ t altered accidentally or by an unauthorized agent . non-repudiation makes sure someone can ’ t say a message didn ’ t originate with them if it came from their identity . availability means making sure data is where it needs to be when it should be there . this includes services as well .
A,A,how would you calculate risk ? a. probability * loss value b.probability * mitigation factor c. ( loss value + mitigation factor ) * ( loss value/probability ) d.probability * mitigation factor,"the correct answer is a . risk is the probability of the occurrence of an event multiplied by the dollar value of loss . there is no mitigation factor that is quantified , so it could be put into a risk calculation ."
D,D,which of the following is one factor of a defense in depth approach to network design ? a. switches b.using linux on the desktop c.optical cable connections d.access control lists on routers,"the correct answer is d. switches and optical cable connections can certainly be part of a network design , but in and of themselves they don ’ t add any security features . you may use linux on the desktop , but without more of a strategy for patch and vulnerability management , linux is no better than other operating systems . access control lists on routers can add an additional layer of security , especially when combined with other elements like firewalls and intrusion detection systems ."
B,B,how would you ensure that confidentiality is implemented in an organization ? a . watchdog processes b.encryption c.cryptographic hashes d.web servers,"the correct answer is b . confidentiality is keeping secret information secret , which means unauthorized users can ’ t access it . encryption is a good way to keep unauthorized users from data because in order to get to the data , they need to have the key . watchdog processes are used to ensure that programs remain running . cryptographic hashes are used to verify the integrity of data . web servers are used to serve up information ."
C,C,an intrusion detection system can perform which of the following functions ? a . block traffic b.filter traffic based on headers c.generate alerts on traffic d.log system messages,"the correct answer is c. firewalls are used to block traffic into a network , though an intrusion prevention system will also block traffic . a packet filtering firewall uses header information , such as source and destination address and port , to determine whether to allow traffic into the network . syslog and the windows event subsystem can be used to log system messages . intrusion detection systems can be used to generate alerts on traffic ."
D,D,which of these would be an example of a loss of integrity ? a . user making changes to a file and saving it b.bad blocks flagged on disk c.credit cards passed in cleartext d.memory failures causing disk drivers to run incorrectly,"the correct answer is d. if a user makes a change to a file and saves it , that ’ s an intentional act and the data is what the user expects and wants . if the disk drive has flagged bad blocks on the disk , the drive won ’ t write any data out to those blocks , so there will be no loss of integrity . credit cards passed in cleartext would be a violation of confidentiality . memory failures , though , could cause a loss of data integrity , even in the case of writing data to the drive . the corrupted data in memory could be written to disk . also , memory failures may cause issues with the disk driver , which may also cause data corruption ."
A,A,what would you use a security information event manager for ? a. aggregating and providing search for log data b.managing security projects c.escalating security events d.storing open-source intelligence,"the correct answer is a . security information event managers are used to aggregate event data , such as log information . once the data has been aggregated , it can be searched and correlated . even though it ’ s called an event manager , it isn ’ t used to manage security projects , nor is it used to escalate security events . other tools can be used to gather and store open-source intelligence ."
C,C,why is it important to store system logs remotely ? a . local systems can ’ t handle it . b.bandwidth is faster than disks . c.attackers might delete local logs . d.it will defend against attacks .,"the correct answer is c. commonly , system logs are stored on the system that generated the log message . certainly local systems can handle the logs they have generated . log messages don ’ t typically consume a lot of space at an individual message level , so bandwidth isn ’ t a problem . transmitting over a network is generally not faster than moving data within local disks . system logs can be used in identifying attacks , but the logs won ’ t defend against attacks . however , if an attacker does compromise a system , the attacker may delete the local logs because they could get access to them ."
B,B,what would be necessary for a tcp conversation to be considered established by a stateful firewall ? a . final acknowledgment message b.three-way handshake complete c.sequence numbers aligned d.syn message received,"the correct answer is b . in tcp , a three-way handshake is used to synchronize sequence numbers and establish a connection . while the sequence numbers are shared , they wouldn ’ t be called aligned , which might suggest that each end was using the same sequence number . a syn message is part of the three-way handshake , but it is not sufficient to establish a connection . option a , “ final acknowledgment message , ” is ambiguous . it could refer to the acknowledgment to a fin message , closing the connection ."
A,A,what is the purpose of a security policy ? a . to provide high-level guidance on the role of security b.to provide specific direction to security workers c.to increase the bottom line of a company d.to align standards and practices,"the correct answer is a . standards and practices should be derived from a security policy , which is the high- level guidance on the role of security within an organization . security does not generally increase the bottom line of a company . policies are not for providing specific directions , which would be the role of procedures ."
C,C,"what additional properties does the parkerian hexad offer over the cia triad ? a . confidentiality , awareness , authenticity b.utility , awareness , possession c.utility , possession , authenticity d.possession , control , authenticity","the correct answer is c. the parkerian hexad takes the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of the cia triad and adds utility , possession ( or control ) , and authenticity ."
D,D,what important event can be exposed by enabling auditing ? a . system shutdown b.service startup c.package installation d.user login,"the correct answer is d. while system shutdown , service startup , and package installation may be events that are logged , they are generally logged by normal system logging . auditing functions are different between windows and linux/unix , but audit systems for both will generate logs when a user logs into a system ."
B,B,what can an intrusion prevention system do that an intrusion detection system can ’ t ? a . generate alerts b.block or reject network traffic c.complete the three-way handshake to bogus messages d.log packets,"the correct answer is b . while an intrusion prevention system can generate alerts , so can an intrusion detection system . both systems may also be able to log packets , as needed . a bogus message likely wouldn ’ t result in a completed three-way handshake , and the handshake shouldn ’ t be completed anyway . an intrusion prevention system can , however , block or reject network traffic , while an intrusion detection system can ’ t ."
A,A,which of these is an example of an application layer gateway ? a . web application firewall b.runtime application self-protection c.java applet d.intrusion prevention system,"the correct answer is a. runtime application self-protection is a plug-in used on an application server to prevent bad messages from impacting the application . a java applet is an implementation of a java program . an intrusion prevention system is used to detect and block potential intrusions . a web application firewall , however , makes decisions based on application layer traffic and will either allow or block that traffic . this makes it an application layer gateway ."
C,C,which information would a packet filter use to make decisions about what traffic to allow into the network ? a. http request message b.ethernet type c.udp source port d.snmp oid,"the correct answer is c. a packet filter would use layer 2/3/4 headers to make decisions . an http request message is at the application layer ( layer 7 ) . ethernet type isn ’ t used to make decisions in a packet filter . snmp oid is also an application layer message . a packet filter would , though , use source or destination ports , potentially , to make decisions about allowing or blocking a packet ."

D,D,what command would you use to get the list of mail servers for a domain ? a. whois mx zone=domain.com b.netstat zone=domain.com mx c.dig domain.com @ mx d.dig mx domain.com,"the correct answer is d. the command whois would be used to query the rir for information about an ip address block . it could also be used to identify information about a domain . the program netstat is used for network statistics . dig can be used , but when you provide the @ parameter , it would be followed by the name server you want to query . the correct way to look for name server records is to use ns as the record type . when you are looking for mail servers , you would look for the mx record type ."
B,B,what would you get from running the command dig ns domain.com ? a . mail exchanger records for domain.com b.name server records for domain.com c.caching name server for domain.com d.ip address for the hostname ns,"the correct answer is b . mail exchanger records would be identified as mx records . a name server record is identified with the tag ns . while an enterprise may have one or even several caching name servers , the caching name server wouldn ’ t be said to belong to the domain because it doesn ’ t have any domain identification associated with it ."
A,A,"if you wanted to locate detailed information about a person using either their name or a username you have , which website would you use ? a. peekyou.com b.twitter.com c.intelius.com d.facebook.com","the correct answer is a. twitter and facebook are social networking sites . while you may be able to locate someone using a username , you may not be able to get detailed information about the user . intelius is a person search site , and you can get detailed information there , but you can ’ t search by username . peekyou is a web site that will allow you to search for people by either name or username ."
C,C,"if you were looking for detailed financial information on a target company , with what resource would you have the most success ? a. linkedin b.facebook c.edgar d.mortimer","the correct answer is c. linkedin is typically used for business networking , but there wouldn ’ t be much in the way of detailed financial information there . facebook is a social networking site , commonly used by people for social interaction . edgar is the database that is maintained by the sec and includes filing information from public companies . mortimer is a joke . bonus points if you recognize what the joke is ."
D,D,what financial filing is required for public companies and would provide you with the annual report ? a . 10-q b.11-k c.401 ( k ) d.14-a,the correct answer is d. the 10-q is a quarterly filing . the 11-k form is related to stock options for employees . the 401 ( k ) is a retirement account . the 14-a report required by the sec for public companies would include the annual report to shareholders .
C,C,"if you were looking up information about a company in new zealand , which rir would you be looking in for data ? a. afrinic b.ripe c.apnic d.lacnic","the correct answer is c. new zealand is located in oceania , considered to be in the pacific rim . this means it falls under the asia pacific network information center ( apnic ) . afrinic covers africa . ripe covers europe , and lacnic covers latin america and parts of the caribbean ."
C,C,"if you receive a rst packet back from a target host , what do you know about your target ? a . the target is using udp rather than tcp . b.the destination port is open on the target host . c.the source port in the rst message is closed . d.the target expects the psh flag to be set .","the correct answer is c. a tcp scan sends messages to the target , expecting to get a response . with a syn or full connect scan , the target will respond with a syn/ack message from an open port . with a closed port , the target will respond with a rst ."
D,D,what is the difference between a syn scan and a full connect scan ? a . a syn scan and a full connect scan are the same . b.a full connect scan sends an ack message first . c.a syn scan uses the psh flag with the syn flag . d.the syn scan doesn ’ t complete the three-way handshake .,"the correct answer is d. a syn scan sends the first syn message and then responds with a rst message after receiving the syn/ack from the target . a full connect scan completes the three-way handshake before sending the rst message . since the full connect scan follows the correct order of the three-way handshake , it doesn ’ t send an ack first . there is also no psh flag sent with the syn flag , since there is no data to push up the stack yet ."
A,A,what is one reason a udp scan may take longer than a tcp scan of the same host ? a. udp will retransmit more . b.udp has more ports to scan . c.udp is a slower protocol . d.udp requires more messages to set up .,"the correct answer is a . there is no defined response to a message to a udp port . it is left entirely up to the application . since a lack of response can mean the message never reached its recipient , the scanning system has to retransmit to closed ports . udp is generally quicker than tcp because of a lack of overhead , it requires no messages to set up , and it has the same number of ports as tcp ."
C,C,why does an ack scan not indicate clearly that ports are open ? a . the scanner has to guess . b.ack is not a supported flag . c.the target system ignores the message . d.ack scans cause a lot of retransmits .,"the correct answer is c. when a system receives an ack message , meaning a tcp segment with the ack flag enabled ( bit position storing a 1 ) , it assumes there is an open connection and there is data that is being acknowledged . when there is no open connection , there is nothing to respond with . the system , not having anything else to do with the ack , discards it . the scanner won ’ t receive a response if the port is open . however , the scanner can ’ t be certain that the message hasn ’ t just been discarded by a firewall . as a result , it indicates that the port is either open or filtered . either would result in no response . the scanner isn ’ t guessing ; it is providing two alternatives but can ’ t be certain which it is . ack is a supported flag in the right circumstances and ack scans do not cause retransmits , since no response means one of two things ."
A,A,what is one reason for using a scan like an ack scan ? a . it may get through firewalls and ids devices . b.it is better supported . c.the code in nmap is more robust . d.an ack scan is needed for scripting support .,"the correct answer is a . evasion is an important concept . you may spend a lot of time working on evading detection or getting blocked . since an ack without an open connection is aberrant , the firewall or ids may ignore it , avoiding detection . as a result , you may be able to get ack messages through . ack scans are not better supported . in fact , there is really no support from the network stack for an ack scan . the code is no more robust in nmap for an ack scan than other scans , or at least there is no evidence of that being the case . ack scans are not needed for scripting support ."
D,D,what does nmap look at for fingerprinting an operating system ? a . the operating system headers b.the application version c.the response from connecting to port 0 d.the ip id field and the initial sequence number,"the correct answer is d. when nmap performs an operating system scan , it is looking for fingerprints of the network stack in the operating system kernel . some of the information that nmap will look at is in the ip id field to see what numbers are used . similarly , it will look at the initial sequence number in tcp messages to see what numbers are used there . the application version isn ’ t relevant to an operating system scan , and there are no operating system headers that would be associated with network traffic . operating system headers could be considered to be part of the source code for the operating system , but nmap wouldn ’ t be able to see those . port 0 is considered an invalid port , so the response to a connection from that port is irrelevant ."
B,B,what is nmap looking at when it conducts a version scan ? a. tcp and ip headers b.application banners c.operating system kernel d.ip id and tcp sequence number fields,the correct answer is b . a version scan with nmap is looking to identify versions of the services/applications running on the target . the kernel is identified with an os scan . tcp and ip headers don ’ t provide application versions . the ip id field and tcp sequence number fields don ’ t provide version information either .
C,C,what is an advantage of using masscan over nmap ? a. masscan has been around longer . b.nmap is hard to use . c.masscan can scan more addresses faster . d.masscan has access to scan more of the internet .,"the correct answer is c. the program masscan is a port scanner , like nmap . however , masscan was developed to scan the entire internet as quickly as possible . as a result , if speed is a consideration , and especially if you are scanning large address blocks , masscan is probably better suited for that task . both nmap and masscan have access to the same address space , and masscan uses the same command-line parameters , for the most part , as nmap , so they are similarly easy to use . nmap has also been around for considerably longer , since the 1990s , than masscan has ."
B,B,"if you were to see the following command run , what would you assume ? hping -s -p 25 10.5.16.2 a . someone was trying to probe the web port of the target . b.someone was trying to probe an email port on the target . c.someone was trying to identify if snmp was supported on 10.5.16.2 . d.someone had mistyped ping .","the correct answer is b. hping is a program used to send specially designed messages to a target . you use command-line parameters to tell hping what to include in the message being sent . the command hping -s -p 25 10.5.16.2 is used to have hping send syn messages to port 25 , the default smtp port , at 10.5.16.2 . it ’ s possible that someone mistyped ping , but those parameters aren ’ t used by ping programs , and since they are coherent for the action above , it makes more sense that they were trying to use hping . snmp and web traffic both use different ports than port 25 ."
D,D,"if you were to see that someone was using openvas , followed by nessus , what might you assume ? a . they were trying to break into a system . b.they didn ’ t know how to use nessus . c.they didn ’ t know how to use openvas . d.they were trying to reduce false positives .","the correct answer is d. vulnerability scanners don ’ t exploit vulnerabilities in order to gain access to a system . they would only exploit a vulnerability to the extent necessary to determine whether a vulnerability exists . if they didn ’ t know how to use nessus or openvas , they likely wouldn ’ t be using them . it ’ s possible they are looking to compare results from the two , but it ’ s also very likely they are trying to compare the results with the intention of reducing false positives ."
A,A,"what is the difference between a false positive and a false negative ? a . a false positive indicates a finding that doesn ’ t exist , while a false negative doesn ’ t indicate a finding that does exist . b.a false positive indicates a finding that does exist , while a false negative doesn ’ t indi- cate a finding that doesn ’ t exist . c.a false positive doesn ’ t indicate a finding that does exist , while a false negative does indicate a finding that doesn ’ t exist . d.a false negative does indicate a finding that doesn ’ t exist , while a false positive doesn ’ t indicate a finding that does exist .","the correct answer is a . a false positive is when a finding is identified when it doesn ’ t actually exist . a false negative is when there is no finding identified but , in fact , there is a vulnerability . a true positive is when a finding is identified that is a vulnerability . a true negative is when a finding isn ’ t identified and there is no known vulnerability ."
D,D,what would be the purpose of running a ping sweep ? a . you want to identify responsive hosts without a port scan . b.you want to use something that is light on network traffic . c.you want to use a protocol that may be allowed through the firewall . d.all of the above .,"the correct answer is d. there may be several reasons for performing a ping sweep . you likely want to identify responsive hosts on the network segment you are targeting . you may not , though , want to use a full port scan . icmp is a lightweight protocol and there is a chance it will be allowed through the firewall , since it ’ s used for troubleshooting and diagnostics ."
C,C,which of these may be considered worst practice when it comes to vulnerability scans ? a. scanning production servers b.notifying operations staff ahead of time c.taking no action on the results d.using limited details in your scan reports,"the correct answer is c. you would be expected to scan production servers , since that would be where you would be most interested to find vulnerabilities . letting operations staff know ahead of time is polite since vulnerability scans may inadvertently knock over systems that would need to be stood back up . being paged in the middle of the night unexpectedly isn ’ t fun . if you know it ’ s coming , it makes it easier . you may have reasons to use limited details in your scan reports , including trying to reduce the disk space used or the paper used in printing the reports . taking no action on the results of a vulnerability scan is about the worst thing you can do when it comes to vulnerability scans . it ’ s worse than not running them , since you could be considered liable because you know about the vulnerabilities but you aren ’ t doing anything about them ."
B,B,which of these may be considered an evasive technique ? a. scanning nonstandard ports b.encoding data c.using a proxy server d.using nmap in blind mode,"the correct answer is b. scanning nonstandard ports isn ’ t evasive . it ’ s just as noisy as , and potentially more detectable than , scanning standard ports . you could use a proxy for some tasks , but all it would do would be to hide your own ip address , which isn ’ t evasive . you could still be blocked or detected . nmap does not have a blind mode . when you encode data , though , you make it harder for the firewall or ids to identify something bad that may be happening , since these devices can ’ t read the messages coming through ."
A,A,"if you were to notice operating system commands inside a dns request while looking at a packet capture , what might you be looking at ? a. tunneling attack b.dns amplification c.dns recursion d.xml entity injection",the correct answer is a. tunneling attacks can be used to hide one protocol inside another . they may be used to send operating system commands using a tunnel system . a dns amplification attack is where a small dns request results in much larger responses sent to the target . dns recursion is used to look up information from dns servers . an xml entity injection attack is a web-based attack and wouldn ’ t be found inside a dns request .
C,C,what is an xmas scan ? a. tcp scan with syn/ack/fin set b.udp scan with fin/psh set c.tcp scan with fin/psh/urg set d.udp scan syn/urg/fin set,"the correct answer is c. the xmas scan is a tcp scan that uses unusual flag settings in the tcp headers to attempt to evade firewalls or idss . the xmas scan uses the fin , psh , and urg flags and is called an xmas scan because it looks like the packet is lit up like a christmas tree . none of the other answers match what an xmas scan is ."
B,B,what would you use megaping for ? a . running exploits b.running a port scan c.issuing manual web requests d.crafting packets,"the correct answer is b. megaping can be used to perform a lot of different functions , but crafting packets , sending manual web requests , and running exploits are not functions it supports . it can , though , run a port scan ."
D,D,what would be a reason to use the override feature in openvas ? a . you want to run a different plug-in for a vulnerability . b.you want to change the scanner settings . c.you want to use tcp rather than udp . d.you want to change a severity rating on a finding .,"the correct answer is d. plug-ins are matched to vulnerabilities . a different plug-in would identify a different vulnerability and there is no way to change that . scanner settings can be changed when you set up a scan . using tcp rather than udp is vague . if you want to change a severity rating from the one supplied by openvas , you would override that rating . you may have mitigations in place or you may have investigated and found the finding to be a false positive ."
C,C,what would you use credentials for in a vulnerability scanner ? a . better reliability in network findings b.authenticating through vpns for scans c.scanning for local vulnerabilities d.running an active directory scan,"the correct answer is c. credentials wouldn ’ t give better reliability in network findings , and vulnerability scanners don ’ t typically provide a way to directly authenticate through a vpn . the vpn client would be expected to be running ahead of time if the network is behind the vpn . an active directory scan is a vague answer , and it may not be something you can do with a vulnerability scanner . if you provide credentials , though , the scanner can authenticate against systems on the network and check for local vulnerabilities ."
C,C,what is fragroute primarily used for ? a . altering network routes b.capturing fragmented packets c.fragmenting application traffic d.fragmenting layer 2 and layer 3 headers,"the correct answer is c. the program fragroute uses configuration statements to determine what should be done to packets destined for a specific host . this may include fragmenting application traffic as well as duplicating and delaying traffic . while there is a possibility of fragmenting layer 3 headers , if layer 2 headers were fragmented , there would be no way to get the message to the destination ."
A,A,what is are rpcs primarily used for ? a. interprocess communications b.interprocess semaphores c.remote method invocation d.process demand paging,"the correct answer is a . remote procedure calls are a way for processes on one system to communicate with processes on another system . this does not preclude two processes on the same system communicating , of course . semaphores are another concept in computer science that can enable interprocess communication . remote method invocation is a way for java programs to implement interprocess communications . process demand paging isn ’ t a thing ."
C,C,what would you be trying to enumerate if you were to use enum4linux ? a . procedures b.linux-based services c.shares and/or users d.memory utilization,"the correct answer is c. enum4linux is a tool that makes use of other , underlying tools to scan systems that have implemented smb . this means enum4linux can be used to enumerate shares or users , as well as other information . none of the other options are valid ."
D,D,how do you authenticate with snmpv1 ? a. username/password b.hash c.public string d.community string,"the correct answer is d. snmpv3 implemented username and password authentication . with version 1 , you used a cleartext community string . snmp doesn ’ t use hashes , and while the word public is often used to describe a community string , a public string is not a way to authenticate with snmpv1 ."
C,C,what smtp command would you use to get the list of users in a mailing list ? a. expd b.vrfy c.expn d.vrml,"the correct answer is c. the smtp command used to expand a mailing list alias to get the underlying email addresses that belong to that mailing list or group is expn . vrfy is verify , and the other two are not valid smtp commands ."
B,B,what type of enumeration would you use the utility dirb for ? a. directory listings b.directory enumeration c.brute force dialing d.user directory analysis,the correct answer is b . the utility dirb uses a word list to attempt to enumerate directories available through a web server that may not be available by looking at all the pages and links in the site .
D,D,what are data descriptions in snmp called ? a. management-based information b.data structure definition c.extensible markup language d.management information base,"the correct answer is d. snmp can be used to retrieve information from remote systems . this information has to be described , including the different data types . all of the information available is described in a management information base ( mib ) . the extensible markup language ( xml ) is a way of packaging data in a structured way but it is not used in snmp ."
A,A,what is the process java programs identify themselves to if they are sharing procedures over the network ? a. rmi registry b.rmi mapper c.rmi database d.rmi process,the correct answer is a. interprocess communications across systems using a network is called remote method invocation . the process with which programs have to communicate to get a dynamic port allocation is the rmi registry . this is the program you query to identify services that are available on a system that has implemented rmi .
C,C,you are working with a colleague and you see them interacting with an email server using the vrfy command . what is it your colleague is doing ? a . verifying smtp commands b.verifying mailing lists c.verifying email addresses d.verifying the server config,"the correct answer is c. the extended smtp ( esmtp ) protocol has a command that is abbreviated vrfy that is used to verify email addresses . a mail server may or may not have exposed this command , even if the server software supports esmtp . expanding mailing lists is expn . you wouldn ’ t use vrfy for a mailing list in that same sense . the other two don ’ t have specific commands that are specified in the smtp protocol definition ."
B,B,what is the smb protocol used for ? a . data transfers using nfs b.data transfers on windows systems c.data transfers for email attachments d.data transfers for windows registry updates,the correct answer is b . the server message block ( smb ) protocol is used for multiple functions on windows networks . one of them is to transfer files ( data ) from one system to another . email attachments would be transmitted using smtp . nfs manages its own data transfer when files are being copied from one system to another . there are no data transfers specifically for windows registry updates .
D,D,which of these is a built-in program on windows for gathering information using smb ? a. nmblookup b.smbclient c.metasploit d.nbtstat,"the correct answer is d. the program nmblookup can be used on linux systems . smbclient is a program that comes with a samba installation that can be used to interact with a system using smb . metasploit has a lot of functions , but it ’ s not built into windows . the program nbtstat , though , can be used to gather information using smb , and it is a program that is installed with windows ."
A,A,what status code will you get if your attempt to use the vrfy command fails ? a . 550 b.501 c.250 d.200,the correct answer is a . the status code you would get if your vrfy command failed against an smtp server is 550 . 200 is the status code for success with a web server . the other codes are not valid in this context .
B,B,what program would you use to enumerate services ? a. smbclient b.nmap c.enum4linux d.snmpwalk,"the correct answer is b . the programs smbclient and enum4linux may be used to enumerate information using smb . the program snmpwalk can be used to enumerate information over snmp . nmap , though , can be used to enumerate services running on all the systems on a network ."
D,D,what version of snmp introduced encryption and user-based authentication ? a . 1 b.2 c.2c d.3,"the correct answer is d. version 1 of snmp used community strings . version 2c also used community strings . version 2 improved version 1 , but it was version 3 that implemented user-based authentication as well as encryption ."
A,A,which of these could you enumerate on a wordpress site using wpscan ? a. plug-ins b.posts c.administrators d.versions,"the correct answer is a . the program wpscan can be used to enumerate themes , users , and plug-ins . it can ’ t be used to enumerate administrators , specifically . it also can ’ t be used to enumerate posts , and since there would only be a single version , you wouldn ’ t enumerate versions ."
B,B,which of these tools allows you to create your own enumeration function based on ports being identified as open ? a. metasploit b.nmap c.netcat d.nbtstat,"the correct answer is b. metasploit can be extended with user-created programs . however , you wouldn ’ t call a metasploit module based on ports being open . netcat doesn ’ t do any enumeration , and nbtstat is a windows program that can ’ t be extended . nmap can be extended with user- written scripts . an nmap script includes a port registration so nmap knows to call that script when specific ports are found to be open ."
C,C,what underlying functionality is necessary to enable windows file sharing ? a . network file system b.common internet file system c.remote procedure call d.remote method invocation,the correct answer is c. smb relies on remote procedure calls ( rpcs ) in order to function . the common internet file system ( cifs ) is an implementation of file sharing and system management using smb . the network file system ( nfs ) is a protocol that makes use of remote procedure calls . remote method invocation ( rmi ) is a way to call procedures remotely over java .
D,D,what is the ipc $ share used for ? a . process piping b.interprocess construction c.remote process management d.interprocess communication,"the correct answer is d. the ipc $ share is a named pipe that enables interprocess communications over a network . while you may be able to do some remote management using the ipc $ share , it is not used for remote process management ."
B,B,what tool does a java program need to use to implement remote process communication ? a. jre b.rmic c.rmir d.jdk,the correct answer is b . the jre is the java runtime environment and is necessary to run java programs . the jdk is the java development kit and is necessary to develop java programs . the program rmic is used to create rmi programs . it creates the stubs necessary for rmi to function . rmir isn ’ t anything .
C,C,which of these passes objects between systems ? a. sunrpc b.smb c.rmi d.nmap,"the correct answer is c. rmi is a way to implement interprocess communications using java . since java is an object-oriented programming language , it would transmit objects . smb is the server message block protocol . sunrpc does remote procedure calls but the data transmitted isn ’ t object oriented . nmap is a program used to scan ports ."
A,A,"if you needed to enumerate data across multiple services and also store the data for retrieval later , what tool would you use ? a. metasploit b.nmap c.rmi d.postgres","the correct answer is a . while nmap is an excellent program in its own right and can be used to enumerate data across multiple services , it doesn ’ t store data for retrieval later without some additional help . metasploit can also be used to enumerate data across multiple services and also uses a database on the backend to store data to be retrieved later . rmi is remote method invocation , a way to implement interprocess communications across a network . postgresql is the database server commonly used underneath metasploit . postgres is a much older version of what is now postgresql ."
D,D,"what are the three times that are typically stored as part of file metadata ? a . moves , adds , changes b.modified , accessed , deleted c.moved , accessed , changed d.modified , accessed , created","the correct answer is d. there are three date and time stamps commonly used in file metadata . when the file is created , that moment is stored . when a file is accessed by a user , that moment is stored . when a file is modified , that moment is stored . accessed is not the same as modified since accessing a file could be read-only . you could open a file expecting to modify it , but not end up doing the modification . the access time still changes . while moves , adds , and changes may sometimes be referred to as mac , like modified , accessed , and created , those are not tasks associated with file times ."
A,A,what is it called when you obtain administrative privileges from a normal user account ? a . privilege escalation b.account migration c.privilege migration d.account escalation,"the correct answer is a . account migration , privilege migration , and account escalation are vague and don ’ t have clearly defined definitions , even if they may exist . privilege escalation , on the other hand , is used to gain elevated privileges when you only have the permissions of a normal user ."
B,B,"what does john the ripper ’ s single crack mode , the default mode , do ? a . checks every possible password b.uses known information and mangling rules c.uses a built-in wordlist d.uses wordlist and mangling rules","the correct answer is b . incremental mode in john will run an attack in which it will try every possible password within specified parameters , meaning john will generate the passwords . the default mode in john is single crack mode , which uses information including the username and the home directory to generate a password using mangling rules . incremental mode does not use wordlists , though john does support the use of wordlists ."
D,D,what is the trade-off for using rainbow tables ? a . disk space prioritized over speed b.accuracy prioritized over disk space c.speed prioritized over accuracy d.speed prioritized over disk space,"the correct answer is d. rainbow tables use precomputed hashes that are mapped to plaintext passwords in order to speed up the process of obtaining the passwords from stored hashes . rainbow tables , though , are very expensive when it comes to disk space . hashes and passwords are stored in the rainbow tables . accuracy is neither sacrificed nor prioritized using rainbow tables . you will give up disk space to get faster cracking times using rainbow tables ."
C,C,which of these is a reason to use an exploit against a local vulnerability ? a. pivoting b.log manipulation c.privilege escalation d.password collection,"the correct answer is c. local vulnerabilities are used against applications that are not listening on the network . this means they require you to be “ local ” to the machine and not remote . in other words , you have to be logged in somehow . a local vulnerability would not be used to collect passwords ; you don ’ t need a vulnerability to do that . similarly , you don ’ t need to make use of a vulnerability to manipulate logs or to pivot . most of those would require you to have elevated permissions , though . a local vulnerability may be exploited to get you those elevated permissions ."
B,B,what is it called when you manipulate the time stamps on files ? a . time stamping b.timestomping c.meta stomping d.meta manipulation,"the correct answer is b. manipulating time stamps on files is called timestomping . it is used to set file times , which may be used to throw off investigations or identify intrusions . none of the other answers are real things ."
A,A,what would an attacker use an alternate data stream on a windows system for ? a . hiding files b.running programs c.storing powershell scripts d.blocking files,"the correct answer is a. alternate data streams are a function of the new technology file system ( ntfs ) , created to support the resource forks of apple ’ s file system in windows nt . since many of the utilities and programs in windows don ’ t natively understand alternate data streams , they can ’ t make use of them and won ’ t show them . the file can be accessed if the user knows how to display and manipulate the alternate data streams ."
A,A,which of these techniques might be used to maintain access to a system ? a . run key in the windows registry b.alternate data stream c .. vimrc file on linux d.powershell,"the correct answer is a . you may use a powershell script to perform functions that could support persistence on a system , but the powershell script alone won ’ t be used to maintain access . alternate data streams won ’ t be of any use for maintaining access , and a .vimrc file is a startup file for the vi editor . the run key in the windows registry , though , could be used to put an entry in that would run a program automatically that could make sure an attacker could get access even after a reboot ."
D,D,"if you were looking for reliable exploits you could use against known vulnerabilities , what would you use ? a. tor network b.meterpreter c.msfvenom d.exploit-db","the correct answer is d. while the tor network may be used to obtain an exploit against a vulnerability , there is some question as to how reliable that exploit may be . the tor network may contain malicious content , even in the case of source code . meterpreter and msfvenom are elements of metasploit that don ’ t have anything to do with locating vulnerabilities . exploit-db is a website and repository of exploits that could be searched to locate an exploit targeting specific and known vulnerabilities ."
C,C,what might an attacker be trying to do by using the clearev command in meterpreter ? a . run an exploit b.manipulate time stamps c.manipulate log files d.remote login,"the correct answer is c. the clearev command is a meterpreter command used to clear the windows event viewer logs . while you may be able to manipulate time stamps and log files in meterpreter , you wouldn ’ t use the clearev command for that . the clearev command does not allow an attacker to log in remotely ."
B,B,you find after you get access to a system that you are the user www-data . what might you try to do very shortly after getting access to the system ? a. pivot to another network b.elevate privileges c.wipe logs d.exploit the web browser,"the correct answer is b . when the apache web server runs on a linux system , it will commonly run as the user www-data . this is a privilege-restricted account that would prevent an attacker from doing much on the system . in order to do anything , like wiping log files or pivoting to another network , you would need to elevate privileges to administrative/root level . exploiting the web browser wouldn ’ t be done in this context . a web server more than likely wouldn ’ t even have a web browser installed ."
C,C,you ’ ve installed multiple files and processes on the compromised system . what should you also look at installing ? a . registry keys b.alternate data streams c.rootkit d.root login,"the correct answer is c. attackers often install extra files and run extra processes on systems . these could easily be detected by manual investigation or , certainly , by automated detection tools . the way around that is to install a rootkit , which may include kernel-mode drivers or replacement system utilities that would hide the existence of these files and processes . alternate data streams may be used to hide files but not processes . registry keys could also hide files but not processes ."
B,B,what does pivoting on a compromised system get you ? a . database access b.a route to extra networks c.higher level of privileges d.persistent access,"the correct answer is b. pivoting is the process of using a compromised system to move onto other systems and networks within the target environment . pivoting does not get you higher-level permissions or persistent access . you may ultimately get to a database server by pivoting , but that ’ s not what pivoting does or is specifically used for . it would be a nice side effect of pivoting ."
B,B,what would you use the program rtgen for ? a . generating wordlists b.generating rainbow tables c.generating firewall rules d.persistent access,"the correct answer is b . the program rtgen is a program that is part of the rcrack suite . rcrack is used to crack passwords with rainbow tables . it is used to generate the rainbow tables that rcrack will use to crack passwords . rainbow tables are not wordlists but mappings of plaintext passwords to hashes , which makes it much easier to get passwords from hashes ."
C,C,which of these would be a way to exploit a client-side vulnerability ? a . sending malformed packets to a web server b.sending large icmp packets c.sending a crafted url d.brute-force password attack,"the correct answer is c. malformed packets could potentially cause a failure or trigger a vulnerability on the server side . large icmp packets aren ’ t likely to do anything and certainly wouldn ’ t exploit a client-side vulnerability . a brute-force password attack isn ’ t exploiting a vulnerability , even if it is an attack technique . sending a crafted url could potentially exploit a client- side vulnerability in a web browser ."
A,A,what is one outcome from process injection ? a . hidden process b.rootkit c.alternate data streams d.steganography,"the correct answer is a. steganography is the process of hiding data inside of other data , such as media files like mp3s , wavs , or video files . an alternate data stream is a secondary data stream attached to a filename in the nt file system . a rootkit can be used to hide processes . it may use process injection but wouldn ’ t be the outcome from process injection . when you inject into a process , you are putting executable operations you have created into the space of another executable . the end result could be an execution thread running your code without any new process name indicating it was running ."
D,D,what tool would you use to compromise a system and then perform post-exploitation actions ? a. nmap b.john the ripper c.searchsploit d.metasploit,"the correct answer is d. john the ripper is used for cracking passwords , while nmap is used for port scanning . they could be part of the overall process of system compromise , but neither could be used to compromise a system , in spite of what it suggests in the matrix . searchsploit is a program used to search a local exploit-db repository . metasploit is an exploit framework that could be used to compromise a system . once the system is compromised , metasploit could then be used for post-exploitation actions using modules that come with it ."
B,B,what application would be a common target for client-side exploits ? a . web server b.web browser c.web application firewall d.web pages,"the correct answer is b . of all of the options presented , only the web browser exists on the client side . by definition , the web server is on the server . a web application firewall is placed with the server to protect the server from application layer attacks . web pages are hosted on a web server . they are not a target for client-side exploits , though they would be used to carry out those attacks ."
C,C,what are two advantages of using a rootkit ? a . installing alternate data streams and registry keys b.creating registry keys and hidden processes c.hiding processes and files d.hiding files and registry keys,the correct answer is c. a rootkit is a piece of malicious software that is used to accomplish several tasks . this may include hiding processes and files through the use of kernel-mode drivers or replaced system utilities . a rootkit may also provide a backdoor for attackers to maintain long-term access to the system after the initial compromise . none of the other answers are things that a rootkit does .
B,B,what could you use to obtain password hashes from a compromised system ? a. john the ripper b.mimikatz c.rainbow tables d.process dumping,"the correct answer is b. john the ripper and rainbow tables are tools for cracking passwords , not gathering or obtaining password hashes . process dumping could possibly yield passwords associated with a certain process/application . however , you may not get password hashes , depending on how the passwords are maintained in memory . process dumping is taking the memory space of a process and writing it out to disk for analysis . mimikatz is a utility and metasploit module that could be used to extract passwords from a compromised system ."
A,A,"in a botnet , what are the systems that tell individual bots what to do called ? a. c2 servers b.irc servers c.http servers d.isc2 servers","the correct answer is a. c2 servers are command and control servers . these are servers that can be used to provide management and control of bots in a botnet . the communication may be irc or http , but not necessarily . the servers aren ’ t called that in a botnet anyway . isc2 servers don ’ t exist ."
C,C,what is the primary difference between a worm and a virus ? a . a worm uses polymorphic code . b.a virus uses polymorphic code . c.a worm can self-propagate . d.a virus can self-propagate .,"the correct answer is c. both worms and viruses could be written to use polymorphic code , which means they could modify what they look like as they propagate . a worm , though , could self-propagate . it ’ s the one distinction between worms and viruses . viruses require some intervention on the part of the user to propagate and execute ."
C,C,what is one advantage of static analysis over dynamic analysis of malware ? a. malware is guaranteed to deploy . b.dynamic analysis is untrustworthy . c.static analysis limits your exposure to infection . d.static analysis can be run in virtual machines .,"the correct answer is c. static analysis is looking at the properties of the executable file and evaluating the assembly language code without running the program . this will limit your exposure to infection , because if you do it right you aren ’ t running the program , which would infect you . dynamic analysis is trustworthy , and malware can ’ t deploy if you don ’ t run it . dynamic analysis is commonly done in virtual machines ."
D,D,what would you use virustotal for ? a . checking your system for viruses b.endpoint protection c.as a repository of malware research d.identifying malware against antivirus engines,"the correct answer is d. virustotal takes dozens of antivirus engines and runs samples through them to identify what malware they might be . virustotal is a website , which means it can ’ t check your system for viruses and also can ’ t do any endpoint protection . while virustotal can identify the name given to a malware sample by different antivirus solutions , to find the research associated with that malware , you would need to check with the antivirus vendor ."
D,D,what are two sections you would commonly find in a portable executable file ? a . text and binary b.binary and data c.addresses and operations d.text and data,"the correct answer is d. pe files have multiple sections that you may find in an executable . two that are very common , though , are .text and .data . the .text section includes all the executable code . the .data section includes all the predefined and initialized variables . the other sections listed in other answers aren ’ t sections of a pe file ."
B,B,what could you use to generate your own malware ? a . empire b.metasploit c.rcconsole d.ida pro,the correct answer is b. metasploit can be used to generate your own malware from one of the payload modules . empire is another exploitation framework built around powershell . ida pro is a debugger and rcconsole doesn ’ t exist .
A,A,what is the purpose of a packer for malware ? a . to obscure the actual program b.to ensure that the program is all binary c.to compile the program into a tight space d.to remove null characters,"the correct answer is a . all programs that have been compiled are in binary . even scripting languages are in binary by the time they hit the processor . packers will make a program smaller , which was initially of some value when bandwidth wasn ’ t as ubiquitous , but a packer doesn ’ t do any compilation . a packer does not remove null characters . a packer can , however , obscure the actual program code because the only executable function is one designed to extract and decompress the real malware ."
C,C,what is the primary purpose of polymorphic code for malware programs ? a . efficiency of execution b.propagation of the malware c.antivirus evasion d.faster compilation,"the correct answer is c. polymorphic means many bodies , which means it has multiple looks . when a program has multiple looks , it can cause antivirus programs to misidentify it . polymorphic code rewrites the program when it is copied or moved from one system or location to another . it isn ’ t more efficient and doesn ’ t help with propagation , though it could be part of the propagation process . it also doesn ’ t speed compilation ."
B,B,what would be one reason not to write malware in python ? a. python interpreter is slow . b.python interpreter may not be available . c.library support is inadequate . d.python is a hard language to learn .,"the correct answer is b. python interpreters may be considered slower to execute than a compiled program , but the difference is negligible and speed of execution generally isn ’ t much of a concern when it comes to malware . python is not a hard language to learn , and there are a lot of community-developed libraries . one challenge , though , is that you may need a python interpreter unless you go through the step of getting a python compiler and compiling your script . windows systems wouldn ’ t commonly have a python interpreter installed ."
C,C,what would you use cuckoo sandbox for ? a. static analysis of malware b.malware development c.dynamic analysis of malware d.manual analysis of malware,"the correct answer is c. cuckoo sandbox is a set of programs and infrastructure used to run malware and identify changes to the system that result . this means it is used for dynamic analysis of malware , not for static analysis . because it ’ s automated , it ’ s not manual . also , it ’ s used for analysis , not development ."
B,B,"if you wanted a tool that could help with both static and dynamic analysis of malware , which would you choose ? a. cutter b.ida c.pe explorer d.malalyzer","the correct answer is b . you need a tool that can perform disassembly if you are doing static analysis . dynamic analysis can make use of disassembled executables , but the tool would need to also be able to execute the code . ida is the only tool there that does both disassembly and execution . cutter only does disassembly . pe explorer does neither , and malalyzer doesn ’ t exist ."
A,A,what is the purpose of using a disassembler ? a . converting opcodes to mnemonics b.converting mnemonics to opcodes c.translating mnemonics to operations d.removing the need for an assembler,"the correct answer is a . an executable contains a set of binary values that the cpu will interpret as operation codes ( opcodes ) when the program is run . these binary values won ’ t generally mean much to people when they are bare . as a result , disassemblers are used to convert opcodes to mnemonics , which are short/abbreviated words that can let someone know what the opcode does ."
C,C,what does the malware that is referred to as a dropper do ? a. drops antivirus operations b.drops cpu protections against malicious execution c.drops files that may be more malware d.drops the malware into the recycle bin,"the correct answer is c. a dropper downloads ( drops ) additional files , which may be malware . it doesn ’ t do any of the things mentioned in the other options ."
B,B,why would you use an encoder when you are creating malware using metasploit ? a . to compile the malware b.to evade antivirus c.to evade user detection d.to compress the malware,the correct answer is b . an encoder is used to alter the look of an executable file . this alteration is done in order to prevent the antivirus program from recognizing the executable as malware . it doesn ’ t compile the malware and doesn ’ t evade user detection . a packer would be used to compress malware .
B,B,"if you were to see the following command in someone ’ s history , what would you think had happened ? msfvenom -i 5 -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -o program a . a poison pill was created . b.a malicious program was generated . c.existing malware was encoded . d.metasploit was started .","the correct answer is b . the program msfvenom is used to convert a payload module from metasploit into an executable program . the malware could potentially be used as part of a poison pill , which is a type of defensive tactic , but it ’ s hard to determine that just from the command line . while the malware is encoded as part of this process , it is not an existing piece of malware . this is not a way to start metasploit , though msfvenom does make use of the metasploit framework ."
A,A,what is the difference between a virus and ransomware ? a. ransomware may be a virus . b.ransomware includes bitcoins . c.ransomware is only generated in russia . d.a virus only runs on windows systems .,"the correct answer is a . this is a bit of a trick question . ransomware may be a virus , which means it is a subset of the category virus . ransomware may ask to be paid in bitcoins , but it doesn ’ t include bitcoins . ransomware has been generated all over the world and viruses run on all operating systems ."
C,C,why would someone use a trojan ? a . it acts as malware infrastructure . b.it evades antivirus . c.it pretends to be something else . d.it ’ s polymorphic .,"the correct answer is c. a trojan , also called a trojan horse , appears to be one thing but is , in fact , another . it can fool users into running the malware because they are expecting something else . a trojan can ’ t evade antivirus if there is a signature that matches the executable . it doesn ’ t act as malware infrastructure , and while it may be polymorphic , that wouldn ’ t be why someone used a trojan ."
B,B,which of these tools would be most beneficial when trying to dynamically analyze malware ? a. cutter b.ollydbg c.metasploit d.av-test,"the correct answer is b . when you are trying to dynamically analyze malware , a debugger is useful because it allows you to run the malware and also control its execution . ollydbg is the only debugger in that list . cutter does disassembly but does not allow you to run the malware and control its execution ."
Client,Client,which end of a client/server communication goes on the infected system if it is communi- cating with infrastructure ?,"the correct answer is client . the malware would act as a client . the client is the end of the conversation that initiates the communication . it ’ s better to initiate from inside the network to get through firewalls , which may block inbound communication flows ."
D,D,which of these would be a reason why it is best for communications to originate from inside the infected network ? a. antivirus b.virtual machines c.intrusion detection d.firewall,"the correct answer is d. the firewall may block inbound communications , which is why it ’ s better for the communication to originate from the inside . either direction could be caught by intrusion detection . virtual machines don ’ t factor in here , and antivirus could catch the malware regardless of which direction the traffic is going , since antivirus uses the executable file rather than the communication stream for detection ."
C,C,which hardware vendor uses the term span on switches ? a. hp b.3com c.cisco d.juniper,"the correct answer is c. different vendors use different terms to refer to port mirroring . cisco uses the term switch port analyzer ( span ) , which leads to the process sometimes being called port spanning ."
B,B,"if you saw the following command line , what would you be capturing ? tcpdump -i eth2 host 192.168.10.5 a . traffic just from 192.168.10.5 b.traffic to and from 192.168.10.5 c.traffic just to 192.168.10.5 d.all traffic other than from 192.168.86.5","the correct answer is b . the expression host 192.168.10.5 is bpf , indicating that tcpdump should only capture packets to and from 192.168.10.5 . if you wanted to only get it to or from , you would need to modify host with src or dest ."
D,D,"in the following packet , what port is the source port ? 20:45:55.272087 ip yazpistachio.lan.62882 > loft.lan.afs3-fileserver : flags [ p. ] , seq 915235445:915235528 , ack 3437317287 , win 2048 , options [ nop , nop , ts val 1310611430 ecr 1794010423 ] , length 83 a. lan b.fileserver c.yazpistachio d.62882","the correct answer is d. tcpdump uses the format hostname/ip.port when it prints an address . the addresses go source > destination , so yazpistachio.lan is the hostname and 62882 is the port on the source address ."
A,A,what is one downside to running a default tcpdump without any parameters ? a. dns requests b.not enough information c.sequence numbers don ’ t show d.tcpdump won ’ t run without additional parameters,"the correct answer is a . by default , tcpdump does name resolution . not only does tcpdump look up port numbers and print their service names , it also triggers a dns lookup . this dns lookup is network traffic , which means that for most packets there is probably a dns lookup request showing in the packet capture ."
C,C,at which protocol layer does the berkeley packet filter operate ? a. internetwork b.transport c.data link d.protocol,"the correct answer is c. bpf operates at the data link layer . this allows filtering down to the mac address . if bpf operated at other layers , you wouldn ’ t get the entire set of packet headers ."
C,C,what do we call an arp response without a corresponding arp request ? a. is-at response b. who-has arp c.gratuitous arp d.ip response,"the correct answer is c. when an arp response is sent without a corresponding arp request , it ’ s an unexpected or unnecessary message . this makes it a gratuitous arp ."
C,C,"which functionality in wireshark will provide you with percentages for every protocol in the packet capture , ordered by protocol layers ? a . conversations b.endpoints c.protocol hierarchy d.statistics view","the correct answer is c. while conversations and endpoints are statistics you can get from wireshark , the protocol hierarchy view shows a layered look at all the protocols in the capture , showing percentages for all of the protocols ."
D,D,which program would you use if you wanted to only print specific fields from the captured packet ? a. fielddump b.tcpdump c.wiredump d.tshark,"the correct answer is d. while tcpdump and tshark can both be used to capture packets , tshark gives you the ability to specify which fields you want to output . the other two options don ’ t exist ."
C,C,the following shows a time stamp . what does the time of this message reflect ? 630 41.897644 192.168.86.210 239.255.255.250 ssdp 750 notify * http/1.1 [ ethernet frame check sequence incorrect ] a . the time since 1970 b.the time of day c.the time since packet start d.there is no time in the summary,"the correct answer is c. by default , wireshark shows a relative time since the start of the packet capture . you can change the field to show absolute time , such as the time of day or the time since 1970 ( epoch time ) . however , that ’ s not what is shown ."
D,D,what protocol is being used in the frame listed in this summary ? 719 42.691135 157.240.19.26 192.168.86.26 tcp 1464 → 61618 [ ack ] seq=4361 ack=1276 win=31232 len=1398 tsval=3725556941 tsecr=1266252437 [ tcp segment of a reassembled pdu ] 443 a. tls b.udp c.ip d.tcp,"the correct answer is d. after the frame number , time , source ip , and destination ip is the protocol . this frame shows tcp is the protocol in use ."
C,C,what program could be used to perform spoofing attacks and also supports plug-ins ? a. arpspoof b.fragroute c.ettercap d.sslstrip,the correct answer is c. arpspoof and ettercap can both be used to perform arp spoofing . ettercap also supports other types of spoofing attacks and plug-ins . sslstrip is a plug-in supported in ettercap . fragroute is a program that does something completely different .
C,C,what would you need to do before you could perform a dns spoof attack ? a . set up a port span b.start up wireshark c.arp spoof d.configure sslstrip,the correct answer is c. a dns spoofing attack requires that the program can see the dns request in order to respond to it . this means there needs to be an arp spoof in place so ettercap ( or another tool ) can get the traffic on the network to get the dns request to respond to .
A,A,which command-line parameter would you use to disable name resolutions in tcpdump ? a . -n b.-i c.-r d.-x,"the correct answer is a . the -i flag indicates which interface you are going to listen on . the -n flag tells wireshark to not do name resolution , leaving you with numeric values for the ip address and port number ."
B,B,why might you have more endpoints shown at layer 4 than at layer 2 ? a. layer 4 multiplexes layer 2 . b.systems may initiate multiple connections to the same host . c.ports are more numerous than mac addresses . d.the ip addresses dictate the endpoints .,"the correct answer is b . the number of mac addresses can be smaller than the number of layer 3 addresses because multiple ip addresses could be associated with a single mac address if the ip addresses are off network ; the mac address for those would be the gateway ’ s mac address . if a system opens multiple connections to the same system , as may happen when rendering a web page , there would be multiple port combinations for the same ip source and destination ."
A,A,what would you use sslstrip for ? a . getting plaintext traffic b.removing all ssl requests c.converting ssl to tls d.converting tls to ssl,"the correct answer is a. sslstrip is used to get plaintext traffic . it does not remove ssl requests , though it may be used to convert an https request to an http request . it does not convert ssl to tls or tls to ssl , and there would be no particular advantage to either of those tasks ."
B,B,why might you have problems with sslstrip ? a. sslstrip is deprecated . b.sslstrip doesn ’ t work with newer versions of tls . c.sslstrip doesn ’ t support tls . d.sslstrip only works with ettercap .,"the correct answer is b. sslstrip was released in 2009 and took advantage of problems in ssl . these problems not only existed in ssl but also continued through early versions of tls . newer versions of tls don ’ t have the same issues , which means sslstrip won ’ t work with them ."
A,A,what does the following line mean ? sequence number : 4361 ( relative sequence number ) a . the sequence number shown is not the real sequence number . b.the sequence number shown has not been incremented . c.the sequence number shown isn ’ t long enough . d.the sequence number shown is the acknowledgment number .,"the correct answer is a. wireshark presents a relative sequence number , which means the initial sequence number as far as wireshark is concerned in presenting it to you is 1 . the relative sequence number increments just as the real sequence number does . the real sequence number , which is a very large value , is hidden to make analysis easier ."
B,B,"what can you say about [ tcp segment len : 35 ] , as provided by wireshark ? a . the window size has changed . b.wireshark has inferred this information . c.wireshark extracted this from one of the headers . d.wireshark has additional detail below .",the correct answer is b . anything you see in wireshark that is in square brackets [ ] is something wireshark has calculated or inferred . it is not something that has been extracted directly from the packet capture . wireshark is helping with the packet analysis .
C,C,what problem does port spanning overcome ? a. switches don ’ t support layer 3 . b.switches aggregate ports . c.switches filter traffic . d.switches are unreliable .,"the correct answer is c. switches filter traffic by only sending traffic destined for the mac address associated with the port to which the system that owns the mac address is attached . switches are reliable . they don ’ t support layer 3 as switches , though there are such things as multilayer switches that include routing functionality . either way , that ’ s not something that port spanning overcomes . switches may aggregate ports , but port spanning doesn ’ t have anything to do with that ."
B,B,what is the /etc/ettercap/etter.dns file used for ? a . enabling firewall rules for ettercap b.configuring hostnames to ip addresses c.setting up mail for ettercap d.disabling arp spoofing in ettercap,the correct answer is b . the ipchains/iptables command to turn on redirection for ettercap is done in a different file . in the etter.dns file is the mapping of hostnames to ip addresses as well as other dns resource records .
A,A,you get a phone call from someone telling you they are from the irs and they are sending the police to your house now to arrest you unless you provide a method of payment imme- diately . what tactic is the caller using ? a. pretexting b.biometrics c.smishing d.rogue access,the correct answer is a. biometrics is the use of a physical attribute to provide authentication . smishing is using short message service ( sms/texting ) to gather information from people . rogue access isn ’ t really anything . pretexting is coming up with a believable story that you can use when trying to perform a social engineering attack on someone .
C,C,you are working on a red-team engagement . your team leader has asked you to use baiting as a way to get in . what are you being asked to do ? a . make phone calls b.clone a website c.leave usb sticks around d.spoof an rfid id,"the correct answer is c. baiting is leaving a lure out in order to gather targets . you could use usb sticks or cds around as bait if they had software on them that would run and “ infect ” the target system in a way that would give you control over them . while all of the other options are related to social engineering , none of them is called baiting ."
B,B,which of the social engineering principles is in use when you see a line of people at a ven- dor booth at a security conference waiting to grab free usb sticks and cds ? a . reciprocity b.social proof c.authority d.scarcity,"the correct answer is b . social proof is in use when it appears to be okay to engage in a behavior because you see others engaging in it . when people see a line of others waiting to grab usb sticks , in spite of knowing they shouldn ’ t trust usb sticks , they may be inclined to lower their defenses . there is no reciprocity or authority here . there may eventually be scarcity , but that ’ s not what would drive people to stand in line to acquire a potentially dangerous item ."
D,D,what is a viable approach to protecting against tailgaiting ? a. biometrics b.badge access c.phone verification d.man traps,"the correct answer is d. biometrics and badge access are forms of physical access control . phone verification could possibly be used as a way of verifying identity , but it won ’ t protect against tailgating . a man trap , however , will protect against tailgating because a man trap allows only one person in at a time ."
B,B,why would you use wireless social engineering ? a . to send phishing messages b.to gather credentials c.to get email addresses d.to make phone calls,"the correct answer is b . especially in enterprises , there is generally some authentication that happens . this could be in the form of a pre-shared key or a username/password combination . either way , when you are using social engineering of wireless networks , you are probably attempting to gather credentials to gain access to sites . it ’ s unlikely you ’ d use this vector for sending phishing messages or getting email addresses , and it wouldn ’ t be used to make phone calls ."
D,D,which social engineering principle may allow a phony call from the help desk to be effective ? a . social proof b.imitation c.scarcity d.authority,"the correct answer is d. while you might be imitating someone , imitation is not a social engineering principle . neither social proof nor scarcity are at play in this situation . however , if you are calling from the help desk , you may be considered to be in a position of authority ."
B,B,why would you use automated tools for social engineering attacks ? a . better control over outcomes b.reduce complexity c.implement social proof d.demonstrate authority,"the correct answer is b. it ’ s debatable whether you get better control over outcomes executing your attacks manually . you would not be implementing social proof or demonstrating authority using an automated attack any more than if you did it manually . you would be reducing complexity , though , since doing it manually means you would be setting up and controlling multiple moving pieces . this gets to be complex , and the attack would fail if you didn ’ t get it just right ."
A,A,what social engineering vector would you use if you wanted to gain access to a building ? a. impersonation b.scarcity c.vishing d.smishing,the correct answer is a. vishing and smishing are non-kinetic approaches to social engineering . scarcity is not a social engineering vector . impersonation is a social engineering vector and the one used to gain unauthorized access to a facility .
C,C,which of these would be an example of pretexting ? a . web page asking for credentials b.a cloned badge c.an email from a former co-worker d.rogue wireless access point,"the correct answer is c. if you sent an email posing as a former co-worker , you could be implementing a couple of different social engineering principles . because you have a story and a means to collect information fraudulently , you are using pretexting . the other attacks are also social engineering , but they are not pretexting ."
C,C,what tool could you use to clone a website ? a. httclone b.curl-get c.wget d.wclone,"the correct answer is c. wget is the only one of these options that is a legitimate program , and it can be used to clone a website ."
B,B,how would someone keep a baiting attack from being successful ? a . disable registry cloning . b.disable autorun . c.epoxy external ports . d.don ’ t browse the internet .,"the correct answer is b . while some people do epoxy usb ports to prevent usb sticks from being inserted , it ’ s not a good approach and wouldn ’ t necessarily keep a baiting attack from working if the bait is a cd-rom . browsing the internet is common and no longer doing that won ’ t protect you against baiting . registry cloning isn ’ t really a thing in this context . disabling autorun would keep any malicious software from running automatically from external devices ."
D,D,what statistic are you more likely to be concerned about when thinking about implement- ing biometrics ? a . false positive rate b.false negative rate c.false failure rate d.false acceptance rate,"the correct answer is d. a false acceptance rate measures how often a biometric system allows unauthorized users access to a facility or area . a false failure ( or reject ) rate is inconvenient , and some organizations may consider that to be an issue , especially if it ’ s very high . however , a high false accept rate is probably more concerning because you are allowing people who are really unauthorized to have access . the other two are not statistics that are measured ; though they correlate to the others , they are not called false positive rate or false negative rate ."
A,A,which of these forms of biometrics is least likely to give a high true accept rate while mini- mizing false reject rates ? a. voiceprint b.iris scanning c.retinal scanning d.fingerprint scanning,"the correct answer is a. voiceprint identification is the least reliable of these options . as a result , it would be the most likely to give you a high false reject rate , which would lower the true accept rate ."
D,D,what attack can a proximity card be susceptible to ? a. tailgating b.phishing c.credential theft d.cloning,"the correct answer is d. a proximity card could enable tailgating , but it ’ s not the only thing—a key could enable tailgating as well . technically , it ’ s not the card that allows tailgating anyway . it ’ s the way the doors are configured and implemented . phishing is unrelated , and technically , credential theft is as well . proximity cards , particularly if they use rfid tags , are susceptible to cloning ."
C,C,which form of biometrics scans a pattern in the area of the eye around the pupil ? a. retinal scanning b.fingerprint scanning c.iris scanning d.uvea scanning,"the correct answer is c. while the retina and the uvea are also parts of the eye , neither of them encloses the pupil and can be used as a means of identification . fingerprints are not part of the eye ."
A,A,what would the result of a high false failure rate be ? a . people having to call security b.unauthorized people being allowed in c.forcing the use of a man trap d.reduction in the use of biometrics,"the correct answer is a . a false acceptance rate would be allowing unauthorized people in . if you are an authorized person but your biometric scanner isn ’ t working reliably and rejects you , you may need to call security or someone else to let you into the building . neither of the other two would be a result of a high false failure rate . they may be solutions to other problems , but not a high false failure rate ."
B,B,"you ’ ve received a text message from an unknown number that is only five digits long . it doesn ’ t have any text , just a url . what might this be an example of ? a. vishing b.smishing c.phishing d.impersonation","the correct answer is b. smishing is short message phishing , which means someone is sending a text message , attempting to fraudulently gather information . vishing is a phone call ( voice ) . phishing can be an overall term but commonly refers to email . impersonation is more of a physical approach ."
A,A,what is an advantage of a phone call over a phishing email ? a . you are able to go into more detail with pretexting . b.phishing attacks are unreliable . c.not everyone has email but everyone has a phone . d.pretexting only works over the phone .,"the correct answer is a. pretexting can work over email just as well as via a phone call . it may be more common for people to have email than a phone , especially a company-owned landline . phishing attacks are very successful , which is why they are so commonly used . with a phone call , though , you could go into more detail and address questions or concerns as they arise . you could include additional layers that you couldn ’ t with an email since you could never be sure if your email was read , or deleted , or caught in a filter ."
B,B,"what is the web page you may be presented with when connecting to a wireless access point , especially in a public place ? a. credential harvester b.captive portal c.wi-fi portal d.authentication point",the correct answer is b . the captive portal is the page that is opened when you connect to a public access point . none of the other answers are real things .

D,D,what are the two types of wireless networks ? a . star and ring b.bus and hybrid c.infrastructure and hybrid d.infrastructure and ad hoc,"the correct answer is d. an infrastructure wireless network is one that uses an access point . an ad hoc wireless network is one organized by the participants . these are the two types of wireless networks . star , ring , bus , and hybrid are all wired topologies ."
B,B,how many stages are used in the wpa handshake ? a . two b.four c.three d.one,the correct answer is b . there are four stages used in a wpa handshake . this four-stage process is used to derive the key and agree on capabilities .
B,B,what mode has to be enabled on a network interface to allow all headers in wireless traffic to be captured ? a. promiscuous b.monitor c.radio d.wireless lan,"the correct answer is b. promiscuous mode is used on network interfaces to collect frames that are not destined for the network interface . this is insufficient on a wireless network because the radio headers are not captured . to capture radio headers , monitor mode needs to be enabled in addition to the promiscuous mode that will always be set to get all frames and all information from the frame . only monitor mode gives the radio headers ."
C,C,what wireless attack would you use to take a known piece of information in order to be able to decrypt wireless traffic ? a. sniffing b.deauthentication c.key reinstallation d.evil twin,"the correct answer is c. sniffing can be used to collect information that may be needed to launch wireless attacks . a deauthentication attack can be used to force a station to generate traffic . an evil twin attack uses a rogue access point to pretend to be a legitimate network . in order to decrypt network traffic , you would need the key . one way to get the key is to reuse information from network traffic that generated a known key . this is a key reinstallation attack ."
C,C,what is the purpose of performing a bluetooth scan ? a. identifying open ports b.identifying available profiles c.identifying endpoints d.identifying vendors,"the correct answer is c. bluetooth doesn ’ t use ports . while profiles are important , you get the profile capabilities during the pairing process . just performing a scan won ’ t get you a list of supported profiles . while you should be able to identify vendors as part of the process of running a bluetooth scan , it ’ s not the purpose of the scan . the purpose is to identify endpoints and their associated addresses so you can run other attacks on them ."
B,B,what is the purpose of a deauthentication attack ? a. disabling stations b.forcing stations to reauthenticate c.reducing the number of steps in the handshake d.downgrading encryption,"the correct answer is b . the purpose of a deauthentication attack is to force stations to reauthenticate . this allows the attacker to collect information from the authentication and handshake . this information could be used later to potentially derive the key , as in wep transmissions . a deauthentication attack doesn ’ t disable stations . there is no way to reduce the number of steps in a handshake , and downgrading encryption is considerably harder , if it ’ s possible at all ."
A,A,what is the policy that allows people to use their own smartphones on the enterprise network ? a . bring your own device b.use your own device c.bring your own smart device d.use your own smart device,the correct answer is a . bring your own device ( byod ) is a policy that allows employees to use their own devices on an enterprise network . this opens the door to the potential for attacks from unknown and unexpected devices . none of the other answers are real things .
C,C,what part of the encryption process was weak in wep ? a. keying b.diffie-hellman c.initialization vector d.seeding vector,"the correct answer is c. the initialization vector is a random value that seeds the key used for encryption and decryption . in wep , the algorithm specified for the initialization vector yielded non- random , predictable values . while the initialization vector is part of keying , it ’ s not the keying itself that was weak . seeding vector is not a real thing , and diffie-hellman is a process used to derive and exchange keys securely . it ’ s not part of wep ."
B,B,what is the four-stage handshake used for ? a . passing keys b.deriving keys c.encrypting messages d.initialization seeding,"the correct answer is b . the four-stage handshake is used to authenticate stations against wireless networks . as part of the handshake , encryption keys are generated . keys are derived on both sides of the transaction rather than being exchanged directly . this is handled during the four-way handshake . keys are not passed . messages can ’ t be encrypted until the four-way handshake is complete and the keys are generated . there is no such thing as initialization seeding ."
C,C,what is the ssid used for ? a. encrypting messages b.providing a mac address c.identifying a network d.seeding a key,"the correct answer is c. the service set identifier ( ssid ) is used to identify a network . it is the name of the network you would select when you were trying to connect to a network . the ssid is not the mac address , and it has nothing to do with keys or encryption ."
D,D,what kind of access point is being used in an evil twin attack ? a. infrastructure b.ad hoc c.wpa d.rogue,"the correct answer is d. ad hoc and infrastructure are types of wireless networks . only infrastructure uses access points , but infrastructure is not a type of access point . wpa is an encryption protocol . a rogue access point , meaning one that isn ’ t legitimate , is used in an evil twin attack by pretending to be a legitimate access point ."
B,B,how does an evil twin attack work ? a. phishing users for credentials b.spoofing an ssid c.changing an ssid d.injecting four-way handshakes,"the correct answer is b . an evil twin attack uses an access point masquerading as the point of connection for stations trying to connect to a legitimate wireless network . stations reach out to make connections to this access point masquerading as another access point . while you may phish for credentials as part of an evil twin attack , credential phishing is not how evil twin attacks work . ssids don ’ t get changed as part of an evil twin attack , meaning no ssid that exists will become another ssid . injecting four-way handshakes won ’ t do much , since four- way assumes both ends are communicating , so the injection of a full communication stream will get ignored ."
C,C,what method might you use to successfully get malware onto a mobile device ? a . using the apple store or google play store b.using external storage on an android c.using a third-party app store d.jailbreaking,"the correct answer is c. the apple app store and the google play store are controlled by apple and google . it ’ s not impossible to get malware onto mobile devices through them , but it ’ s very difficult because apps get run through a vetting process . while some android devices will support external storage , it ’ s not an effective way to get malware onto a smartphone or other mobile device . jailbreaking can lead to malware being installed , but it ’ s not the means to get malware onto a mobile device . third-party app stores can be a good means to get malware onto mobile devices because some third-party app stores don ’ t vet apps that are submitted ."
B,B,what would you use a bluebugging attack for ? a. identifying bluetooth devices nearby b.listening to a physical space c.enabling a phone ’ s camera d.gathering data from a target system,the correct answer is b . a bluebugging attack is used to gain access to a smartphone in order to initiate a call out to the attacker ’ s phone . this allows the attacker to listen to anything happening around the phone owner . scanning is used to identify bluetooth devices nearby . there is no particular attack used to enable a phone ’ s camera . gathering data from a target device or system is bluesnarfing .
A,A,"what would a signal range for a bluetooth device commonly be ? a . 300 ft. b.3,000 ft. c.75 ft. d.500 ft .","the correct answer is a . while there are bluetooth devices that will transmit much further , a common range is about 300 feet ( 100 meters ) for bluetooth 4.0 ."

B,B,why is bluesnarfing potentially more dangerous than bluejacking from the standpoint of the victim ? a. bluejacking sends while bluesnarfing receives . b.bluejacking receives while bluesnarfing sends . c.bluejacking installs keyloggers . d.bluesnarfing installs keyloggers .,"the correct answer is b. bluesnarfing is an attack that connects to a bluetooth device in order to grab data from that device . bluesnarfing sends data to the attacker . bluejacking can be used to send information to a bluetooth device , such as a text message . neither of these attacks install keyloggers ."
C,C,what tool would allow you to run an evil twin attack ? a. wireshark b.ettercap c.wifiphisher d.aircrack-ng,"the correct answer is c. wireshark is used to capture packets/frames from a network . ettercap is used for spoofing attacks . the program aircrack-ng can be used to crack wireless keys . wifiphisher , though , can be used to set up an evil twin attack ."
B,B,what types of authentication are allowed in a wpa-encrypted network ? a. handshake and personal b.personal and enterprise c.enterprise and handshake d.802.11 and personal,"the correct answer is b. wpa supports both personal and enterprise authentication . personal authentication makes use of a pre-shared key , while enterprise authentication uses usernames and passwords to authenticate specific users , providing accounting and access control , meaning we know exactly who has connected to the network ."
D,D,what wouldn ’ t you see when you capture wireless traffic that includes radio headers ? a . capabilities b.probe requests c.ssids d.network type,"the correct answer is d. radio headers in a wireless network will provide you with the capabilities of the devices , since that ’ s negotiated during the association process . you will also see probe requests asking what networks are in the area , including specific networks that a station knows about . these requests will include the ssid . the responses will also include the ssid . you will not get the network type in the headers ."
B,B,what protocol is used for a smurf attack ? a. dns b.icmp c.tcp d.smtp,"the correct answer is b . while dns is also used for amplification attacks , smurf attacks are a result of someone sending icmp echo requests to the broadcast address of a network . the echo responses would be sent to the address in the source of the request , which would be spoofed . if enough systems respond , the volume of responses can overwhelm the target system ."
C,C,"if you were to see ' or 1=1 ; in a packet capture , what would you expect was happening ? a. cross-site scripting b.command injection c.sql injection d.xml external entity injection","the correct answer is c. an sql injection attack makes use of sql queries , which can include logic that may alter the flow of the application . in the example provided , the intent is to force the result of the sql query to always return a true . it is quoted the way it is to escape the existing query already in place in the application . none of the other attacks use a syntax that looks like the example ."
C,C,which protocol is commonly used for amplification attacks ? a. tcp b.smtp c.dns d.xml,"the correct answer is c. because tcp uses a three-way handshake , spoofing like that needed in amplification is very difficult . smtp also uses tcp . xml is used for data structure and presentation . dns is often used for modern amplification attacks ."
A,A,what is the purpose of a syn flood ? a . fill up connection buffers at the operating system b.fill up connection buffers in the web server c.fill up connection buffers at the application layer d.fill up connection buffers for udp,"the correct answer is a . a syn flood takes advantage of the three-way handshake . a syn message alone will consume a connection buffer at the operating system . until the operating system has passed the three-way handshake , the request won ’ t make it to the web server at the application layer . syn is not a header flag used with udp ."
B,B,how does a slowloris attack work ? a . holds open connection buffers at the operating system b.holds open connection buffers at the web server c.holds open connection buffers at the application layer d.holds open connection buffers for udp,"the correct answer is b . a slowloris attack is used to hold open connection buffers at the web server . enough of these requests will consume all of the possible connections for the web server . the application layer doesn ’ t factor in here because there are no connection buffers at the application layer . web servers don ’ t use udp for http requests , and slowloris is an attack against a web server ."
C,C,what would be the result of sending the string aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa into a variable that has been allocated space for 8 bytes ? a. heap spraying b.sql injection c.buffer overflow d.slowloris attack,the correct answer is c. heap spraying uses dynamically allocated space to store attack code . a slowloris attack is used to hold open web server connection buffers . an sql injection will be used to inject sql queries to the database server . a buffer overflow sends more data than space has been allocated for into the application .
D,D,what is the target of a cross-site scripting attack ? a . web server b.database server c.third-party server d.user,"the correct answer is d. a cross-site scripting attack uses a scripting language to run in the browser . since the browser is with the user , ultimately the attack targets the user , even if the injection code is stored in a database server ."
D,D,"if you were to see the following in a packet capture , what would you think was happening ? < ! entity xxe system `` file : ///etc/passwd '' > ] > a. cross-site scripting b.sql injection c.command injection d.xml external entity injection","the correct answer is d. cross-site scripting attacks usually use javascript or perhaps vbscript . sql injection uses sql . command injection uses operating system commands . the fragment shows xml using an external entity . this is , then , an xml external entity injection ."
B,B,what protection could be used to prevent an sql injection attack ? a . buffer overflows b.input validation c.xml filtering d.lateral movement,the correct answer is b. sql injection attacks take data injected from the user/attacker . any data sent in from a user should always be validated before being acted on . nothing coming in from a user should be trusted . none of the other answers could be used to prevent an sql injection attack .
A,A,what security element would be a crucial part of a defense in depth network design ? a. firewall b.siem c.web application firewall d.log management system,"the correct answer is a . a defense in depth network design makes use of multiple prevention layers to make breaching the inside of the network quite a bit harder . a siem is used to collect and correlate intelligence and log data . a web application firewall protects against application layer attacks . a log management system is just what it says . a firewall , though , is commonly used in a defense in depth network design ."
A,A,what does a defense in breadth approach add ? a . consideration for a broader range of attacks b.protection against sql injection c.buffer overflow protection d.heap spraying protection,"the correct answer is a . defense in breadth starts with defense in depth and takes a broader range of attack strategies into consideration . defense in breadth doesn ’ t necessarily protect against sql injection and probably doesn ’ t protect against buffer overflows or heap spraying attacks . those protections may possibly be achieved , but ultimately defense in breadth would achieve them by taking a broader range of attacks into consideration ."
C,C,what attack injects code into dynamically allocated memory ? a . buffer overflow b.cross-site scripting c.heap spraying d.slowloris,"the correct answer is c. a buffer overflow attack is an attack against data in the stack , which is known about at compile time and , as a result , is not dynamic . cross-site scripting attacks and slowloris attacks don ’ t inject code into memory . a heap spraying attack , though , injects code into the heap , which is where dynamically allocated memory is taken from ."
C,C,"if you were to see the following in a packet capture , what attack would you expect is happening ? % 3cscript % 3ealert ( 'wubble ' ) ; % 3c/script % 3e a. sql injection b.command injection c.cross-site scripting d.buffer overflow","the correct answer is c. a buffer overflow takes an excess amount of data and tries to store it into a memory location that can ’ t accommodate it . an sql injection attack uses sql . command injection attacks use operating system commands . a cross-site scripting attack uses a scripting language such as javascript or vbscript . the script is injected using a < script > html tag , and the % 3c is a way of encoding < while % 3e is a way of encoding > . this means % 3cscript % 3e would be decoded to < script > ."
B,B,what has been done to the following string ? % 3cscript % 3ealert ( 'wubble ' ) ; % 3c/script % 3e a. base64 encoding b.url encoding c.encryption d.cryptographic hashing,the correct answer is b. base64 encoding takes non-printable characters and encodes them in a way that they can be rendered in text . encryption would generally render text unreadable to people . a cryptographic hash is a way of generating a fixed-length value . url encoding takes text and uses hexadecimal values to represent the characters . this is text that has been converted into hexadecimal so they can be used in a url .
D,D,what technique does a slow read attack use ? a . small http header requests b.small http body requests c.small http post requests d.small file retrieval requests,"the correct answer is d. a slowloris attack uses small http requests to hold open a web server ’ s available connections . there are attacks that use body requests in a slow fashion . however , a slow read attack tries to download"
D,D,"what element could be used to facilitate log collection , aggregation , and correlation ? a. log manager b.firewall c.ids d.siem","the correct answer is d. while a firewall and an ids will generate logs , they don ’ t collect them . a log manager will collect logs and perhaps aggregate them , but it probably doesn ’ t correlate log messages . a siem , though , will consume logs , aggregate them , and correlate them ."
A,A,what is the target of a command injection attack ? a . operating system b.web server c.database server d.user,"the correct answer is a . a command injection sends operating system commands into a web application so they can be run by the operating system . the web server ( meaning the web server application ) is not the target of the command injection , nor is the database server or the user ."

B,B,what could you use to inform a defensive strategy ? a. siem output b.attack life cycle c.logs d.intrusion detection system,"the correct answer is b. siem output is useful and may have some value in understanding current attacks . the same is true with logs and intrusion detection systems . however , the attack life cycle is a structured way to understand how attacks happen in order to better inform a defensive strategy so controls can be implemented for each of the phases of the attack ."
C,C,what information does a buffer overflow intend to control ? a. stack pointer b.frame pointer c.instruction pointer d.buffer pointer,"the correct answer is c. the stack pointer indicates where the stack is in memory . the frame pointer indicates which part of the stack is being used for the current frame . there is no buffer pointer from the perspective of the operating system , though applications do use pointers and they do point to buffers . an instruction pointer tells the processor where the next instruction to be executed is . controlling this piece of information can allow the attacker to control the execution flow of the program ."
C,C,"with a rotation of 4 , what does erwaiv decrypt to ? a. waive b.wave c.answer d.decrypt","the correct answer is c. this is a rotation cipher with a key of 4 . when you rotate the alphabet by 4 , you end up with e = a , r = n , w = s , and so on . in addition to not being the right decryption , none of the others have the correct number of letters . in a substitution cipher like a rotation cipher , you will always have the same number of letters in the output as you do in the input ."
B,B,what do you call a message before it is encrypted ? a . text b.plain text c.bare words d.bare text,"the correct answer is b . in cryptography , any data or message that is in an unencrypted state is called plaintext . the output from a cryptographic process is ciphertext . while you may have text as input to an encryption process , the word text would be ambiguous in this context . the other two are unrelated to cryptography ."
C,C,what does pgp use to verify identity ? a . central authority b.web of users c.web of trust d.central trust authority,"the correct answer is c. where certificate authorities use a centralized mechanism for verification of users or certificate subjects , pgp uses a decentralized model . pgp calls this a web of trust , where individual users sign keys that belong to other people to validate that they are who they say they are . all of the other answers are made-up terms ."
A,A,what principle is used to demonstrate that a signed message came from the owner of the key that signed it ? a. non-repudiation b.non-verifiability c.integrity d.authority,"the correct answer is a . integrity is part of the cia triad but isn ’ t the principle that ties a signed message back to the subject of the signing certificate . non-verifiability is nonsense , and authority isn ’ t relevant here . instead , non-repudiation means someone can ’ t say they didn ’ t send a message if it was signed with their key . this assumes the key was in their possession and password protected , meaning no one else could use it ."
C,C,what is diffie-hellman used for ? a . key management b.key isolation c.key exchange d.key revocation,"the correct answer is c. certificates can be revoked but that ’ s not what diffie-hellman is used for . key management is a much broader topic than key exchange , which is what diffie-hellman is used for . it is a process that allows two parties to an encrypted conversation to mutually derive the same key starting with the same base value ."
D,D,how did 3des improve on des ? a . made the key longer b.used two keys c.changed algorithms d.used three keys,"the correct answer is d. 3des , or triple des , uses three keys . the first key is used to encrypt the plaintext . the second key is used to decrypt the ciphertext resulting from the first round of encryption . finally , the third key is used to encrypt the ciphertext that resulted from the decryption with the second key . the key wasn ’ t made longer because the 168 bits used in 3des aren ’ t used in a single key . the underlying des algorithm is still used ."
A,A,"what improvement does elliptic curve cryptography make ? a . smaller keys improve speed b.algorithm is more complex c.doesn ’ t use factoring , which is better d.longer keys","the correct answer is a. algorithms used for elliptic curve cryptography are not more complex , necessarily . while they don ’ t use factoring , that fact alone doesn ’ t necessarily make the algorithms better . instead , elliptic curve cryptography relies on the assumption that determining a discrete logarithm of a point on an elliptic curve can ’ t be computed in a consistent way . the keys that result from elliptic key cryptography are actually smaller than those that result from factoring with large prime numbers ."
B,B,what is it called when two different data sets yield the same cryptographic hash ? a. paradox b.collision c.crash d.unrealistic,"the correct answer is b . when two different data sets yield the same cryptographic hash , it is called a collision . it relates to a mathematical problem called the birthday paradox , but two values being the same is not a paradox . it ’ s also not unrealistic , nor is it a crash ."
C,C,which of the following terms can be used in a description of asymmetric key encryption ? a . private key b.multifactor c.public key d.single factor,"the correct answer is c. asymmetric key cryptography uses two related keys . one key is used for encryption and one is used for decryption . these keys are referred to as the public and private key . because it ’ s the public key that is used to encrypt messages to the owner of the paired private key , this type of encryption is commonly referred to as public key cryptography . it is neither single factor nor multifactor since it ’ s not authentication ."
C,C,"if alice were to send an email to bob , what key would she use to encrypt the message ? a. pgp key b.private key c.public key d.symmetric key","the correct answer is c. public key cryptography works because the public key can be provided to anyone . the only thing you can do with the public key is encrypt a message that could be decrypted by the matched private key . this process uses asymmetric encryption , so it ’ s not a symmetric key . the private key has to be with the owner of the key and protected . if that key gets out , any messages encrypted to the owner by the public key could be decrypted . pgp uses public/private keys and does not have its own type of key ."
D,D,what property allows you to trust someone trusted by a certificate authority you trust ? a. commutative property b.associative property c.communicative property d.transitive property,"the correct answer is d. what this says is that if a trusts b and b trusts c , then a can trust c. this is an application of the transitive property . the commutative and associative properties are both also mathematical principles . there is no such thing as a communicative property ."
A,A,why is symmetric key encryption typically used over asymmetric key encryption ? a. it ’ s faster . b.it ’ s more secure . c.it ’ s easier to implement . d.it isn ’ t encumbered with patents .,"the correct answer is a. symmetric key encryption is generally used instead of asymmetric key encryption because symmetric key encryption uses shorter keys and fewer resources , resulting in shorter times for encryption and decryption . this does not make it more secure , even if that word were to be defined in this context . symmetric key is not easier to implement and asymmetric key is not encumbered with patents , which is why c and d are wrong ."
B,B,what is it called when both symmetric and asymmetric keys are used ? a . fast cryptosystem b.hybrid cryptosystem c.super-symmetric cryptosystem d.dual key cryptosystem,"the correct answer is b . when both symmetric and asymmetric keys are used , typically where the asymmetric key is used to protect the symmetric key , it is called a hybrid cryptosystem . the other options don ’ t exist ."
D,D,what is md5 or sha-1 commonly used for in cryptography ? a . media access control ( mac ) b.machine authentication code ( mac ) c.message access code ( mac ) d.message authentication code ( mac ),the correct answer is d. media access control ( mac ) is an address attached to physical network interfaces . the correct answer is message authentication code because sha-1 and md-5 are used as message authentication codes to ensure that a message has not been tampered with . this means it is being authenticated .
B,B,what type of encryption does pgp use ? a. symmetric key b.asymmetric key c.trusted key d.web key,"the correct answer is b. pgp uses public and private keys . the public key is stored in a public place like a key repository . since there are two keys , pgp uses asymmetric key encryption , sometimes known as public key encryption ."

D,D,you are on a cisco router and want to identify the path a packet travels to a specific ip . which of the following is the best command choice for this ? a. ping b. ifconfig c. tracert d. traceroute,"the correct answer is d. you probably knew , right up front , this was a traceroute question , but the trick comes when deciding which traceroute command to use . traceroute , depending on which system you use it on , can use a variety of different protocols and techniques . for example , on windows systems , traceroute ( using the command name tracert ) uses icmp packets and the ttl ( time to live ) value to map out a path between origin and destination . the first packet sent uses a ttl of 1 , to show the first hop . the next packet sets it to 2 , and so on , until the destination is found . each icmp response provides information on the current hop ( unless icmp is being filtered ) . on a linux system ( and on cisco devices ) , you ’ d use the command traceroute , and udp would be used instead of icmp ."

( choose two . ) a. dumpster diving b . reviewing financial sites for company information c. clicking links within the company ’ s public website d. calling the company ’ s help desk line e. employing passive sniffing,"the correct answer is d , e. this one may be a little tricky , but only because we live and work in the real world and this is an exam question . ec-council has several questionable takes on things regarding real-world application and what they say you should remember for your exam , and this is one of those examples . just remember ecc wants you to know active and passive footprinting can be defined by two things : what you touch and how much discovery risk you put yourself in . social engineering in and of itself is not all passive or active in nature . in the case of dumpster diving , it ’ s also considered passive ( despite the real-world risk of discovery and the action you have to take to pull it off ) according to ecc . however , pick up a phone and call someone inside the company or talk to people in the parking lot , and you ’ ve exposed yourself to discovery and are now practicing active footprinting . as far as “ passive ” sniffing goes , sniffing isn ’ t a footprinting action at all . the term “ passive sniffing ” concerns the act of simply plugging in and watching what comes by , without any packet injection or other action required on your part ."

C,C,an organization has a dns server located in the dmz and other dns servers located on the intranet . what is this implementation commonly called ? a . dynamic dns b. dnssec c. split dns d. auto dns,"the correct answer is c. the idea behind split dns is pretty simple : create two zones for the same domain , with one just for the internal network , while the other is used by any external networks . internal hosts are directed to the internal domain name server . separating the domain servers greatly limits the footprinting an attacker can perform from the outside ."

C,C,metasploit is a framework allowing for the development and execution of exploit code,"the correct answer is c. tcp 53 is the default protocol and port number for zone transfers . dns actually uses both tcp and udp to get its job done , and if you think about what it ’ s doing , they make sense in particular circumstances . a name resolution query and reply ? small and quick , so use port 53 on udp . a zone transfer , which could potentially be large and requires some assurance it all gets there ? port 53 on tcp is the answer ."
"B,C","B,C",against a remote host and is designed for use in pen testing . the framework consists of,"the correct answer is b , c. nslookup uses one of two modes—interactive and non-interactive . non-interactive mode is simply the use of the command followed by an output . for example , nslookup www.google.com will return the ip address your server can find for google . interactive mode is started by simply typing nslookup and pressing enter . your default server name will display , along with its ip address , and a caret ( > ) will await your next command . in this scenario , we ’ ve used interactive mode and set the type to mx , which we all know means “ please provide me with all the mail exchange servers you know about . ”"
A,A,"several libraries , each performing a specific task and set of functions . which library is","the correct answer is a. dns poisoning makes the most sense here . in many cases ( such as mine right now in my own work-from-home office ) , a vpn connection back to the company forces you to use the company dns instead of your local solution . in this example , john ’ s connection from home uses a different dns server for lookups than that of the business network . it ’ s entirely possible someone has changed the cache entries in his local server to point to a different ip than the one hosting the real website—or that the hackers have set up to provide the defaced version . the fact that the web files haven ’ t changed and the site seems to be displaying just fine from inside the network also backs this up . if it turns out john ’ s dns modification is the only one in place , there is a strong likelihood that john is being specifically targeted for exploitation—something john should take very seriously . lastly , the hosts and lmhosts files can also play a big role in this kind of scenario ; however , if an attacker already has that kind of access to john ’ s computer , he has bigger problems than the corporate website ."
E,E,considered the most fundamental component of the metasploit framework ?,"the correct answer is e. the soa record holds all sorts of information , and when it comes to dns poisoning , the ttl is of primary interest . the shorter the ttl , the less time records are held in cache . while it won ’ t prevent dns poisoning altogether , it can limit the problems a successful cache poisoning attack causes ."
B,B,a. msf core,"the correct answer is b . if you have a windows active directory ( ad ) network , having ad-integrated dns servers offers some great advantages . for example ( and directly from microsoft , i might add ) , 'with directory-integrated storage , dynamic updates to dns are conducted based upon a multimaster update model . in this model , any authoritative dns server , such as a domain controller running a dns server , is designated as a primary source for the zone . because the master copy of the zone is maintained in the active directory database , which is fully replicated to all domain controllers , the zone can be updated by the dns servers operating on any domain controller for the domain . ' zones are also replicated and synchronized to new domain controllers automatically whenever a new one is added to an active directory domain , and directory replication is faster and more efficient than standard dns replication . but having an active directory server facing externally is a horrible idea ."
B,B,b. msf base,"the correct answer is b . the edgar database ( url holds various competitive intelligence information on businesses and is an old favorite of ec-council . per previous documentation from the site , 'all companies , foreign and domestic , are required to file registration statements , periodic reports , and other forms electronically through edgar . anyone can access and download this information for free . here you ’ ll find links to a complete list of filings available through edgar and instructions for searching the edgar database .

C,C,c. msf interfaces,"the correct answer is c. traceroute ( at least on windows machines with the tracert command ) tracks a packet across the internet by incrementing the ttl on each packet it sends by one after each hop is hit and uses , ensuring the response comes back explicitly from that hop and uses its name and ip address . this provides your path and latency times . it accomplishes this by using icmp echo packets to report information on each “ hop ” ( route ) from the source to destination . as an aside , linux machines use a series of udp packets by default to carry out the same function in traceroute ."
A,A,d. rex,"the correct answer is a. metadata is all the information about a file that ’ s not necessarily visible at first glance . for example , say you take a great ( but of course blurry and out of focus ) picture of bigfoot in the woods . the picture itself would be the focus of everyone looking at it , but the file holds all sorts of other information too—like potentially where you were when you took it and what time of day it was . metagoofil lets you pull information like this off of all sorts of data files , which can be helpful in putting together a social engineering plan ( among other things ) ."
"A,B,D,F","A,B,D,F",a zone file consists of which records ? ( choose all that apply . ) a. ptr b. mx c. sn d. soa e. dns f. a g. ax,"the correct answer is a , b , d , f. a zone file contains a list of all the resource records in the namespace zone . valid resource records are as follows : srv ( service ) : this record defines the hostname and port number of servers providing specific services , such as a directory services server . soa ( start of authority ) : this record identifies the primary name server for the zone . the soa record contains the hostname of the server responsible for all dns records within the namespace as well as the basic properties of the domain . ptr ( pointer ) : this record maps an ip address to a hostname ( providing for reverse dns lookups ) . you don ’ t absolutely need a ptr record for every entry in your dns namespace , but ptr records are usually associated with email server records . ns ( name server ) : this record defines the name servers within your namespace . these servers are the ones that respond to your client ’ s requests for name resolution . mx ( mail exchange ) : this record identifies your email servers within your domain . cname ( canonical name ) : this record provides for domain name aliases within your zone . for example , you may have an ftp server and a web service running on the same ip address . cname records could be used to list both within dns for you . a ( address ) : this record maps an ip address to a hostname and is used most often for dns lookups ."

( choose all that apply . ) a . it appears to be part of an ack scan . b . it appears to be part of an xmas scan . c. it appears port 4083 is open . d. it appears port 4083 is closed .,"the correct answer is b , d. the exam will ask you to define scan types in many , many ways . it may be a simple definition match ; sometimes it ’ ll be some crazy wireshark or tcpdump listing . in this example , you see a cleaned-up traffic exchange showing packets from one host being sent one after another to the second host , indicating a scan attempt . the packets have the fin , urg , and psh flags all set , which tells you it ’ s an xmas scan . if the destination port is open , you won ’ t receive anything back ; if it ’ s closed , you ’ ll see a rst/ack . this tells you port 4083 looks like it ’ s closed ( see line four of the response ) . as an addendum , did you know there are two reasons why it ’ s called an xmas scan ? the first is because it lights up an ids like a christmas tree , and the second is because the flags themselves are all lit . as an aside , you probably won ’ t see this much out in the real world because it just really doesn ’ t have much applicability . but on your exam ? oh yes—it ’ ll be there ."
D,D,"you are examining traffic and notice an icmp type 3 , code 13 response . what does this normally indicate ? a . the network is unreachable . b . the host is unknown . c. congestion control is enacted for traffic to this host . d. a firewall is prohibiting connection .","the correct answer is d. icmp types will be covered in depth on your exam , so know them well . type 3 messages are all about “ destination unreachable , ” and the code in each packet tells you why it ’ s unreachable . code 13 indicates “ communication administratively prohibited , ” which indicates a firewall filtering traffic . granted , this occurs only when a network designer is nice enough to configure the device to respond in such a way , and you ’ ll probably never get that nicety in the real world , but the definitions of what the “ type ” and “ code ” mean are relevant here ."
A,A,which port-scanning method presents the most risk of discovery but provides the most reliable results ? a. full-connect b. half-open c. null scan d. xmas scan,"the correct answer is a . a full-connect scan runs through an entire tcp three-way handshake on all ports you aim at . it ’ s loud and easy to see happening , but the results are indisputable . as an aside , the -st switch in nmap runs a full-connect scan ( you should go ahead and memorize that one ) ."

( choose two . ) a . -- script b . -z c. -sa d. -sc,"the correct answer is a , d. nmap is a great scanning tool that provides numerous options , and you ’ ll need to know the syntax very well . the nse ( nmap scripting engine ) is a portion of the tool that allows the use of scripts in scanning . directly from nmap ’ s site ( url nmap.org/book/nse.html ) : “ nse is activated with the -sc option ( or -- script if you wish to specify a custom set of scripts ) and results are integrated into nmap normal and xml output. ” i ’ ve seen mentioned in other study material that the -a switch is also considered as an nse function . this switch turns on scanning that reports on version detection , operating system fingerprinting , and a variety of other activities . a pretty good wrap-up of nmap switches is located at url"
D,D,which of the following commands is the best choice to use on a linux machine when attempting to list processes and the uids associated with them in a reliable manner ? a. ls b. chmod c. pwd d. lsof,"the correct answer is d. supported in most unix-like flavors , the “ list open files ” command ( lsof ) provides a list of all open files and the processes that opened them . the lsof command describes , among other things , the identification number of the process ( pid ) that has opened the file , the command the process is executing , and the owner of the process . with optional switches , you can also receive all kinds of additional information . as an aside , the command ps ( for process status ) is probably an even better choice for the task listed ."
D,D,you want to display active and inactive services on a windows server machine . which of the following commands best performs this service ? a. sc query b. sc query type=all c. sc query type=service d. sc query state= all,"the correct answer is d. the sc command will definitely make an appearance or two somewhere on the exam . per microsoft , sc . exe retrieves and sets control information about services . you can use sc . exe for testing and debugging service programs . service properties stored in the registry can be set to control how service applications are started at boot time and run as background processes . sc . exe parameters can configure a specific service , retrieve the current status of a service , as well as stop and start a service . a sampling of uses for the sc command follows : • sc config determines the status of a service at system startup as well as sets a service to run automatically , manually , or not at all . • sc query displays information about services , drivers , and types of both . without parameters , it returns a list of all running services and associated information . to create a list of all services , use sc query state= all . • sc start starts a service that is not running . • sc stop stops a running service . • sc pause pauses a service . • sc continue resumes a paused service . • sc enumdepend lists the services that can not run unless the specified service is running . • sc qc displays the configuration of a particular service . and finally , one more quick note : remember there is always a space after the equals sign ( and not one before ) . syntax is important , and ecc will probably spring that on you ."
B,B,an administrator enters the following command on a linux system : iptables -t nat -l which of the following best describes the intent of the command entered ? a . the administrator is attempting a port scan . b . the administrator is configuring ip masquerading . c. the administrator is preparing to flood a switch . d. the administrator is preparing a dos attack,"the correct answer is b . do you remember network address translation ? it ’ s a neat little technology that allows lots of internal hosts , using nonroutable private addressing , to access the internet by borrowing and using a single address ( or a group of addresses ) managed by a router or other system . ip masquerading is much the same thing ; it ’ s just accomplished through a linux host . in short , a linux machine can act as a nat translator by employing proper routing configuration , using one nic to communicate with the internal network and one with the external network , and enabling ip masquerading . looking over the man page for the command ( one copy can be found at url ipset.netfilter.org/iptables.man.html ) , we see that iptables is an administration tool for ipv4 packet filtering and nat . per the man page , “ iptables is used to set up , maintain , and inspect the tables of ipv4 packet filter rules in the linux kernel . several different tables may be defined. ” each table contains a number of built-in chains and may be enabled by iptables -t tablename -switch , where tablename is filter , nat , mangle , raw , or security , and switch equates to the option you wish to enable . for example , -a appends rules , -d deletes rules , and -r replaces rules ."

B,B,you are told to monitor a packet capture for any attempted dns zone transfer . which port should you focus your search on ? a. tcp 22 b. tcp 53 c. udp 22 d. udp 53,"the correct answer is b. dns uses port 53 in both udp and tcp . port 53 over udp is used for dns lookups . zone transfers are accomplished using port 53 over tcp . considering the reliability and error correction available with tcp , this makes perfect sense ."
B,B,a team member issues the nbtstat.exe -c command . which of the following best represents the intent of the command ? a . it displays the ip route table for the machine . b . it displays the netbios name cache . c. it displays active and inactive services . d. it puts a nic into promiscuous mode for sniffing,"the correct answer is b . per microsoft , regarding the nbtstat command : “ nbtstat is designed to help troubleshoot netbios name resolution problems . when a network is functioning normally , netbios over tcp/ip ( netbt ) resolves netbios names to ip addresses . it does this through several options for netbios name resolution , including local cache lookup , wins server query , broadcast , lmhosts lookup , hosts lookup , and dns server query . the nbtstat command removes and corrects preloaded entries using a number of case-sensitive switches. ” syntax for the command includes the following : • nbtstat - a < name > performs a netbios adapter status command on the computer name specified by < name > . the adapter status command returns the local netbios name table for that computer as well as the mac address of the adapter card . • nbtstat -a < ip address > performs the same function as the -a switch , but using a target ip address rather than a name . • nbtstat - c shows the contents of the netbios name cache , which contains netbios-name-to-ip-address mappings . • nbtstat -n displays the names that have been registered locally on the system by netbios applications such as the server and redirector . • nbtstat -r displays the count of all netbios names resolved by broadcast and by querying a wins server . • nbtstat -r purges the name cache and reloads all # pre entries from the lmhosts file ( # pre entries are the lmhosts name entries that are preloaded into the cache ) . • nbtstat -rr sends name release packets to the wins server and starts a refresh , thus re-registering all names with the name server without a reboot being required . • nbtstat -s lists current netbios sessions and their status , including statistics ."

C,C,"you want to run a scan against a target network . you ’ re concerned about it being a reliable scan , with legitimate results , but want to take steps to ensure it is as stealthy as possible . which scan type is best in this situation ? a. nmap -sn targetipaddress b. nmap -so targetipaddress c. nmap -ss targetipaddress d. nmap -st targetipaddress","the correct answer is c. a half-open scan , as defined by this nmap command line , is the best option in this case . the syn scan was created with stealth in mind because the full-connect scan was simply too noisy ( or created more entries in an application-level logging system , whichever your preference ) . as far as the real world is concerned , it ’ s a fact that most idss can pick up a syn scan just as easily as a full connect , but if you go slow enough , both a syn and a full connect can be almost invisible . a connect scan is indistinguishable from a real connection , whereas a syn scan can definitely be distinguishable . in other words , the full connect will look like any other conversation—just bunches of them all at once—whereas a syn scan will show a lot of systems answering a conversation starter only to be met with rude silence . the lesson is any scan can and probably will be seen in the real world by a monitoring ids ; however , the slower you go and the better you characterize your target without putting additional packets on the wire , the less chance you ’ ll have of being seen , all things being equal ."
C,C,what is the second step in the tcp three-way handshake ? a. syn b. ack c. syn/ack d. ack-syn e. fin,"the correct answer is c. admittedly , this is an easy one , but i ’ d bet dollars to doughnuts you will see it in some form on your exam . it ’ s such an important part of scanning and enumeration because , without understanding this basic principle of communication channel setup , you ’ re almost doomed to failure . a three-way tcp handshake has the originator forward a syn . the recipient , in step 2 , sends a syn and an ack . in step 3 , the originator responds with an ack . the steps are referred to as syn , syn/ack , ack ."
A,A,in which scanning method would an attacker send init chunks to targets and await responses ? a. sctp init scan b. sctp cookie echo scan c. sctp half-open scan d. sctp full-connect scan,"the correct answer is a . this one requires a bit of background knowledge , so read on . in october 2000 , sctp ( stream control transmission protocol ) became an ietf proposed standard and was published as rfc 2960 . it was originally designed within the ietf signaling transport ( sigtran ) working group to address tcp ’ s shortcomings relating to telephony signaling over ip networks , and it has since evolved into a general-purpose ietf transport protocol . sctp provides a connectionoriented , reliable , full-duplex , congestion- and flow-controlled layer 4 channel ; however , unlike both tcp and udp , sctp offers new delivery options that better match diverse applications ’ needs . whereas you ’ re probably familiar with the three-way handshake of tcp , sctp uses a four-way handshake ( you can read all the technical details at url .org/doc/html/rfc4960 ) : 1 . the client sends an init signal to the server to initiate an association . 2 . on receipt of the init signal , the server sends an init-ack response to the client . this init-ack signal also contains a “ state cookie. ” this cookie holds an assortment of information , including a message authentication code ( mac ) , a timestamp corresponding to the creation of the cookie , the life span of the state cookie , and other information necessary to establish the connection . 3 . on receipt of this init-ack signal , the client sends a cookie-echo response , which just echoes the state cookie . 4 . the server verifies the state cookie ’ s authenticity and allocates the resources for the association , sends a cookie-ack response acknowledging the cookieecho signal , and moves the association to the established state . shutdown for sctp is just as graceful : 1 . the client sends a shutdown signal to the server . 2 . the server responds by sending a shutdown-ack acknowledgement . 3 . the client then sends a shutdown-complete signal back to the server . sctp can also abruptly close , using an abort signal due to an error in the sctp stack or at the request of the client . sctp does not support half-open connections . an sctp init scan sends sctp init “ chunks ” to targets and awaits responses . if the response is init+ack , the port is open ; an abort response means the port is closed ."

( choose all that apply . ) a . the host will be attempting to retrieve an html file . b . the source port field on this packet can be any number between 1024 and 65535 . c. the first packet from the destination in response to this host will have the syn and ack flags set . d. the packet returned in answer to this syn request will acknowledge the sequence number by returning 10 .","the correct answer is a , d. yes , it is true that port 80 traffic is generally http ; however , there are two problems with this statement . the first is all that is happening here is an arbitrary connection to something on port 80 . for all we know , it ’ s a listener , telnet connection , or anything at all . second , assuming it ’ s actually an http server , the sequence described here would do nothing but make a connection—not necessarily transfer anything . sure , this is picky , but it ’ s the truth . next , sequence numbers are acknowledged between systems during the three-way handshake by incrementing by 1 . in this example , the source sent an opening sequence number of 10 to the recipient . the recipient , in crafting the syn/ack response , will first acknowledge the opening sequence number by incrementing it to 11 . after this , it will add its own sequence number to the packet ( a random number it will pick ) and send both off ."
B,B,which tcp flag instructs the recipient to ignore buffering constraints and immediately send all data ? a. urg b. psh c. rst d. buf,"the correct answer is b . this answer normally gets mixed up with the urg flag because we all read it as “ urgent. ” however , just remember the key word with psh is “ buffering. ” in tcp , buffering is used to maintain a steady , harmonious flow of traffic . every so often , though , the buffer itself becomes a problem , slowing things down . a psh flag tells the recipient stack that the data should be pushed up to the receiving application immediately ."

A,A,"given the following wireshark filter , what is the attacker attempting to view ? ( ( tcp.flags == 0x02 ) || ( tcp.flags == 0x12 ) ) || questionsq ( ( tcp.flags == 0x10 ) & & ( tcp.ack==1 ) & & ( tcp.len==0 ) ) a. syn , syn/ack , ack b. syn , fin , urg , and psh c. ack , ack , syn , urg d. syn/ack only","the correct answer is a. you ’ ll see bunches of wireshark questions on your exam—it ’ s probably the subject ec-council loves the most regarding this chapter—and syntax will be the key to answering all of them . for this particular question subject , remember wireshark has the ability to filter based on a hexadecimal numbering system assigned to tcp flags . the assigned flag hex numbers are fin = 1 , syn = 2 , rst = 4 , psh = 8 , ack = 16 , and urg = 32 . putting these hex numbers together ( for example , syn + ack = 12 ) allows you to simplify a wireshark filter . for example , tcp.flags == 0x2 looks for syn packets , tcp.flags == 0x16 looks for ack packets , and tcp.flags == 0x12 looks for both ( the attacker here will see all syn packets , all syn/ack packets , and all ack packets ) . in this example , the decimal numbers were used , just not in a simplified manner . as far as the rest of wireshark filtering syntax goes , there are a couple key points to remember . first , be sure to remember it uses double “ equals ” signs ( == ) in the expression ( ip.addr = 10.10.10.0/24 won ’ t work , but ip addr == 10.10.10.0/24 will ) . next , know the difference between the definitions for “ and ” and “ or. ” an “ and ” in the filter means both expressions will be queried and displayed , but only if both are true . ( in other words , “ show me all packets containing this source address and headed toward this destination ip . if it ’ s from this source but going somewhere else , ignore it . if it ’ s headed to this destination but is not from this source , ignore it. ” ) an “ or ” in the filter means either of the expressions can be true ( that is , “ show me all packets containing this source address and any packets going to this destination ip , no matter the destination or source address , respectively , for the two ” ) ."
B,B,a target machine ( with a mac of 12:34:56 : ab : cd : ef ) is connected to a switch port . an attacker ( with a mac of 78:91:00 : ed : bc : a1 ) is attached to a separate port on the same switch with a packet capture running . there is no spanning of ports or port security in place . two packets leave the target machine . message 1 has a destination mac of e1:22 : ba:87 : ac:12 . message 2 has a destination mac of ff : ff : ff : ff : ff : ff . which of the following statements is true regarding the messages being sent ? a . the attacker will see message 1 . b . the attacker will see message 2 . c. the attacker will see both messages . d. the attacker will see neither message,"the correct answer is b . this question is all about how a switch works , with a little mac knowledge thrown in . remember that switches are designed to filter unicast messages but to flood multicast and broadcast messages ( filtering goes to only one port , whereas flooding sends to all ) . broadcast mac addresses in the frame are easy to spot—they ’ re always all fs , indicating all 48 bits turned on in the address . in this case , message 1 is a unicast address and went off to its destination , whereas message 2 is clearly a broadcast message , which the switch will gladly flood to all ports , including the attacker ’ s . other versions of this same question will center on the efforts an attacker can use to see that packet . should the attacker desire to see all messages , a mac flood could turn the switch into a hub , effectively flooding all packets to all ports . another option is to span a port ( break into the configuration of the switch and tell it to send all traffic destined for a specific port to that port and to the attacker ’ s ) . lastly , port stealing ( a totally fun memorization term from ec-council ) allows an attacker to take advantage of the race condition ( where the switch is constantly updating mac address bindings for ports ) during a mac flood attempt to effectively steal a port and sniff all traffic aimed for the target machine ."
B,B,"you have tapped into a network subnet of your target organization . you begin an attack by learning all significant mac addresses on the subnet . after some time , you decide to intercept messages between two hosts . you send broadcast messages to host a showing your mac address as belonging to host b . what is being accomplished here ? a. arp poisoning to allow you to see all messages from either host without interrupting their communications process b. arp poisoning to allow you to see messages from host a to host b c. arp poisoning to allow you to see messages from host b to host a d. arp poisoning to allow you to see messages from host a destined to any address e. arp poisoning to allow you to see messages from host b destined to any address","the correct answer is b. arp poisoning is a relatively simple way to place yourself as the “ man in the middle ” and spy on traffic ( by the way , be careful with the term man in the middle because it usually refers to a position where you are not interrupting traffic ) . the arp cache is updated whenever your machine does a name lookup or when arp ( a broadcast protocol ) receives an unsolicited message advertising a mac-to-ip match . in this example , you ’ ve told host a that you hold the mac address for host b . host a will update its cache , and when a message is being crafted by the os , it will happily put the spoofed address in its place . just remember that arp poisoning is oftentimes noisy and may be easy to discover if port security is enabled : depending on implementation , the port will lock ( or amber in nerd terminology ) when an incorrect mac tries to use it or when multiple broadcasts claiming different macs are seen . additionally , watch out for denial-of-service side effects of attempting arp poisoning—you may well bring down a target without even trying to , not to mention host b is eventually going to find out it ’ s not receiving anything from host a . as a side note , detection of arp poisoning can be done with a tool called xarp ( www.chrismc.de ) ."

( choose two . ) a. dhcp starvation b. mac flooding c. promiscuous mode d. arp spoofing,"the correct answer is b , d. switches filter all traffic—unless you tell them otherwise , make them behave differently , or the traffic is broadcast or multicast . if you can gain administrative access to the ios , you can tell it to behave otherwise by configuring a span port ( which sends copies of messages from all ports to yours ) . legitimate span ports are designed for things such as a network ids . to make the switch behave differently ( at least on older switches , because newer ones don ’ t allow this much anymore ) , send more mac addresses to the switch than it can handle . this fills the cam and turns the switch , effectively , into a hub ( sometimes called a fail open state ) . using a tool such as macof or yersinia , you can send thousands and thousands of fake mac addresses to the switch ’ s cam table . arp spoofing doesn ’ t really involve the switch much at all—it continues to act and filter traffic just as it was designed to do . the only difference is you ’ ve lied to it by faking a mac address on a connected port.the poor switch , believing those happy little arp messages , will forward all packets destined for that mac address to you instead of the intended recipient . how fun !"

"A,C,D","A,C,D",which of the following could provide a useful defense against arp spoofing ? ( choose all that apply . ) a . using arpwall b . setting all nics to promiscuous mode c. using private vlans d. using static arp entries,"the correct answer is a , c , d. arpwall is an application available for download from sourceforge ( url it gives an early warning when an arp attack occurs and simply blocks the connection . virtual lans ( vlans ) provide a means to create multiple broadcast domains within a single network . machines on the same switch are in different networks , and their traffic is isolated . since arp works on broadcast , this can help prevent large-scale arp spoofing . per courseware , static arp entries are a good idea and at least one way to fix arp poisoning , since no matter what is banging around out on the network , the system uses the static mapping you configured . an ids may also be helpful in spotting arp shenanigans , but it wouldn ’ t necessarily do anything about them ."

"B,C","B,C",which of the following are the best preventive measures to take against dhcp starvation attacks ? ( choose two . ) a . block all udp port 67 and 68 traffic . b . enable dhcp snooping on the switch . c. use port security on the switch . d. configure dhcp filters on the switch .,"the correct answer is b , c. dhcp starvation is a denial-of-service attack ec-council somehow slipped into the sniffing section . the attack is pretty straightforward : the attacker requests all available dhcp addresses from the server , so legitimate users can not pull an address and connect or communicate with the network subnet . dhcp snooping on a cisco switch ( using the ip dhcp snooping command ) creates a whitelist of machines that are allowed to pull a dhcp address . anything attempting otherwise can be filtered . port security , while not necessarily directly related to the attack , can be a means of defense as well . by limiting the number of macs associated with a port , as well as whitelisting which specific macs can address it , you could certainly reduce an attacker ’ s ability to drain all dhcp addresses . as a side note , you may also see a question relating to how dhcp works in the first place . an easy way to remember it all is with the acronym dora : discover , offer , request , and acknowledge . additionally , packets in dhcpv6 have different names than those of dhcpv4 . dhcpdiscover , dhcpoffer , dhcprequest , and dhcpack are known as solicit , advertise , request ( or confirm/renew ) , and reply , respectively ."

D,D,which of the following is used by soap services to format information ? a. unicode b. html entities c. ntfs d. xml,"the correct answer is d. simple object access protocol ( soap ) is a protocol designed for exchanging structured information within web services across multiple variant systems . in other words , it ’ s a way for a program running in one kind of operating system ( let ’ s say windows server 2019 or 2020 ) to communicate with a program on another ( such as linux ) . it uses http and xml to exchange information and specifies how to encode http headers and xml files so that applications can talk to each other . one great advantage to this is also a great detriment , security-wise : because http is generally allowed through most firewalls , applications using soap can generally communicate at will throughout networks . soap injection attacks allow you to inject malicious query strings ( much like sql injection , as a matter of fact ) that might give you the means to bypass authentication and access databases behind the scenes . soap is compatible with http and smtp , and messages are typically one-way in nature ."
A,A,a web application developer is discussing security flaws discovered in a new application prior to production release . he suggests to the team that they modify the software to ensure users are not allowed to enter html as input into the application . which of the following is most likely the vulnerability the developer is attempting to mitigate against ? a. cross-site scripting b. cross-site request forgery c. connection string parameter pollution d. phishing,"the correct answer is a. xss flaws occur whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a web browser without proper validation or escaping . the basics of this attack revolve around website design ( or web application design on that site ) , dynamic content , and invalidated input data . usually when a web form pops up , the user inputs something , and then some script dynamically changes the appearance or behavior of the website based on what has been entered . xss occurs when the bad guys take advantage of that scripting ( java , for instance ) and have it perform something other than the intended response . for example , suppose instead of entering what you ’ re supposed to enter in a form field , you enter an actual script . the server then does what it ’ s supposed to—it processes the code sent from an authorized user . the best defense against this is proper design and good input validation before the app ever sees production in the first place ."
C,C,which of the following is a common soa vulnerability ? a. sql injection b. xss c. xml denial of service d. cgi manipulation,"the correct answer is c. service-oriented architecture ( soa ) is a software design idea that is based on specific pieces of software providing functionality as services between applications . the idea is to define how two applications can interact so that one can perform a piece of work for the other ( or , better said , on behalf of the other ) . each interaction is independent of any other and is self-contained . soa programmers make extensive use of xml to carry all this out , and that leaves the application vulnerable to crafty xml tampering . if an attacker can somehow pass an xml message with a large payload , or any of a number of other bad content , they can perform an xml denialof-service attack on an soa application . this isn ’ t to imply it ’ s the only type of dos available or that soa is uniquely vulnerable ( for instance , the only thing a specifically crafted xml attack can affect ) . it ’ s just a question , so don ’ t read too much into it ."
B,B,the source code of software used by your client seems to have a large number of gets ( ) alongside sparsely used fgets ( ) . what kind of attack is this software potentially susceptible to ? a. sql injection b . buffer overflow c. parameter tampering d. cookie manipulation,"the correct answer is b . a buffer overflow is an attempt to write more data into an application ’ s prebuilt buffer area in order to overwrite adjacent memory , execute code , or crash a system ( application ) . by inputting more data than the buffer is allocated to hold , you may be able to crash the application or machine or alter the application ’ s data pointers . gets ( ) is a common source of buffer overflow vulnerabilities because it reads a line from standard input into a buffer until a terminating eof is found . it performs no check for buffer overrun and has been largely replaced by fgets ( ) . also , technically speaking , there is oftentimes no length to check for—it just writes until it reaches a termination point ."
C,C,which of the following would be the best choice in the prevention of xss ? a . challenge tokens b . memory use controls c. httponly flag in cookies d. removing hidden form fields,"the correct answer is c. in addition to input validation controls ( always good for bunches of vulnerability mitigations ) , setting the httponly flag in cookies can be used in mitigation against some xss attacks . cross-site scripting occurs when an attacker interjects code into a web page form field that does not have appropriate input validation configured . the httponly cookie flag can stop any injected code from being accessible by a client-side script . per owasp , if the httponly flag is included in the http response header , the cookie can not be accessed through client-side script . as a result , even if a cross-site scripting flaw exists , and a user accidentally accesses a link that exploits this flaw , the browser ( primarily internet explorer ) will not reveal the cookie to a third party ."
B,B,you are examining log files and come across this url : url 74 % 63 % 2f % 70 % 61 % 73 % 73 % 77 % 64which of the following best describes this potential attack ? a . this is not an attack but a return of ssl handshakes . b . an attacker appears to be using unicode . c. this appears to be a buffer overflow attempt . d. this appears to be an xss attempt .,"the correct answer is b. unicode is just another way to represent text , so why not use it to try to get past an ids ? of course , in the real world , every ids would probably be looking for weird unicode requests anyway ( it isn ’ t ciphered or encrypted and really does nothing more than provide a cursory obfuscation ) , but let ’ s just stick with ec-council and the ceh exam here for now . this request appears to be attempting a grab of some passwords : % 2e % 2e % 2f % 2e % 2e % 2f % 2e % 2f % = .. / .. / .. / % 65 % 74 % 63 = etc % 2f = / % 70 % 61 % 73 % 73 % 77 % 64 = passwd"
B,B,which msfconsole command allows you to connect to a host from within the console ? a. pivot b. connect c. get d. route,"the correct answer is b . questions on metasploit can be very generalized or—like this question—pretty darn specific . msfconsole , opened with the msfconsole command , is a common method of interfacing with metasploit . as put by offensive security , it provides an “ all-in-one ” centralized console and allows you efficient access to virtually all of the options available in the msf , and it ’ s the only supported way to access most of the features within metasploit . commands used in the interface are listed and discussed pretty well on offensive security ’ s site ( url metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole-commands/ ) . the connect command acts like a miniature netcat clone , supporting ssl , proxies , pivoting , and file sends . by issuing the connect command with an ip address and port number , you can connect to a remote host from within msfconsole the same as you would with netcat or telnet . in addition to msfconsole , you should also know that the metasploit architecture holds five modules : exploits , payloads , encoders , nops , and auxiliary . exploits is the basic module , used to encapsulate ( and configure behaviors for ) an exploit . payloads establishes a communication channel between metasploit and the target . auxiliary is used to run things like port scanning and fuzzing ."
D,D,which character is your best option in testing for sql injection vulnerability ? a . the @ symbol b . a double dash c. the + sign d. a single quote,"the correct answer is d. sql injection is all about entering queries and commands into a form field ( or url ) to elicit a response , gain information , or manipulate data . on a web page , many times entries into a form field are inserted into a sql command . when you enter your username and information into the fields and click the button , the sql command in the background might read something like this : select orderid , firstname , lastname from orders in sql , a single quote is used to indicate an upcoming character string . once sql sees that open quote , it starts parsing everything after it as string input . if there ’ s no close quote , an error occurs because sql doesn ’ t know what to do with the submitted characters . if the web page is configured poorly , that error will return to you and let you know it ’ s time to start injecting sql commands ."
A,A,"an angry former employee of the organization discovers a web form vulnerable to sql injection . using the injection string select * from orders_pend where location_ city = 'orlando ' , he is able to see all pending orders from orlando . if he wanted to delete the orders_pend table altogether , which sql injection string should he use ? a . select * from orders_pend where location_city = orlando ' ; drop table orders_pend -- b . select * from orders_pend where 'orlando ' ; drop_table -- c. drop table orders_pend where 'orlando = 1 ' -- d. where location_city = orlando ' 1 = 1 ' : drop_table --","the correct answer is a. sql queries usually read pretty straightforward , although they can get complicated rather quickly . in this case , you ’ re telling the database , “ can you check the table orders_pend and see whether there ’ s a city called orlando ? oh , by the way , since you ’ re executing any command i send anyway , just go ahead and drop the table called orders_pend while you ’ re at it. ” the only thing missing from sql queries is a thank-you at the end . as an aside , you can easily restrict which sql verbs any user can make use of ( through ddl and dmal statements ) , and you should . allowing all users to drop tables and the like is akin to making your standard user a domain administrator ; it ’ s a rather dumb idea !"
C,C,efforts to gain information from a target website have produced the following error message : microsoft ole db provider for odbc drivers error '80040e08 ' [ microsoft ] { obdc sql server driver } which of the following best describes the error message ? a . the site may be vulnerable to xss . b . the site may be vulnerable to buffer overflow . c. the site may be vulnerable to sql injection . d. the site may be vulnerable to a malware injection .,"the correct answer is c. once again , you will get a few “ gim me ” questions on the exam . the error message clearly displays a sql error , telling us there ’ s an underlying sql database to contend with and it ’ s most likely not configured correctly ( or we wouldn ’ t be getting an error message like this—through a web interface and telling us exactly what ’ s there—in the first place ) ."
C,C,which of the following is a standard method for web servers to pass a user ’ s request to an application and receive data back to forward to the user ? a. ssi b. ssl c. cgi d. csi,"the correct answer is c. common gateway interface ( cgi ) is a standardized method for transferring information between a web server and an executable ( a cgi script is designed to perform some task with the data ) . cgi is considered a server-side solution because processing is done on the web server and not the client . because cgi scripts can run essentially arbitrary commands on your system with the permissions of the web server user and because they are almost always wrapped so that a script will execute as the owner of the script , they can be extremely dangerous if not carefully checked . additionally , all cgi scripts on the server will run as the same user , so they have the potential to conflict ( accidentally or deliberately ) with other scripts ( an attacker could , for example , write a cgi script to destroy all other attached databases ) ."
A,A,"an attacker performs a sql injection attack but receives nothing in return . she then proceeds to send multiple sql queries , soliciting true or false responses . which attack is being carried out ? a . blind sql injection b. sql denial of service c. sql code manipulation d. sql replay","the correct answer is a . blind sql injection is really kinda neat , even if you ’ re not a nerd . sometimes a security admin does just enough to frustrate efforts , and you don ’ t receive the error messages or returned information you originally counted on . so , to pull out the info you want , you start asking it ( the sql database ) a lot of true-or-false questions . for example , you could ask the database , “ true or false—you have a table called users ? ” if you get a true , then you know the table name and can start asking questions about it . for example , “ hey , database , got an entry in your users table named admin ? ” ( select * from users where name='admin ' and 1=1 ; # ' ; ) . blind sql injection is a long , laborious effort , but it can be done ."
A,A,a tester is attempting a cspp attack . which of the following is she most likely to use in conjunction with the attack ? a. ; b. : c. ‘ d. “ e. -- f. ~,"the correct answer is a. cspp ( connection string parameter pollution ) is another form of injection attack . in many web applications , communications with back-end databases make use of the semicolon to separate parameter requests . much as with url tampering , in cspp you just change the communication string and see what happens : add a semicolon , type in your request , and watch to see if it was successful ."
A,A,"an attacker is attempting to elevate privileges on a machine by using java or other functions , through nonvalidated input , to cause the server to execute a malicious piece of code and provide command-line access . which of the following best describes this action ? a . shell injection b . file injection c. sql injection d. url injection","the correct answer is a . when it comes to web application attacks , there are many vectors and avenues to take . one of the more common is injecting something into an input string to exploit poor code . ec-council defines these attacks in many ways . also known as command injection , shell injection is defined as an attempt to gain shell access using java or other functions . in short , the attacker will pass commands through a form input ( or other avenue ) in order to elevate privileges and open a shell for further malicious actions . it occurs when commands are entered into form fields instead of the expected entry ."
B,B,"an attacker is successful in using a cookie , stolen during an xss attack , during an invalid session on the server by forcing a web application to act on the cookie ’ s contents . how is this possible ? a . a cookie can be replayed at any time , no matter the circumstances . b. encryption was accomplished at the application layer , using a single key . c. authentication was accomplished using xml . d. encryption was accomplished at the network layer .","the correct answer is b . cookies can be used for many things . if you can grab all user cookies , you can see what they visited and sometimes even how long they ’ ve been there . cookies can also hold passwords—and because most people use the same password on multiple sites , this can be a gold mine for the attacker . in this scenario , the cookie is being replayedby an attacker to gain access . if a single key is used in encryption , a replay attack is possible , because cookie authentication is carried out at the application layer . it is for this reason some organizations require browsers to automatically delete cookies on termination ."
C,C,"html forms include several methods for transferring data back and forth . inside a form , which of the following encodes the input into the uniform resource identifier ( uri ) ? a . head b . put c. get d. post","the correct answer is c. an http get is a method for returning data from a form that “ encodes ” the form data to the end of the uri ( a character string that identifies a resource on the web , such as a page of text , a video clip , an image , or an application ) . for example , if you were to enter a credit card number in a form using get , the resulting url might look something like url where the long number is obviously a credit card number just sitting there waiting for anyone to use . generally speaking , a post is “ more secure ” than a get , although they both have their uses . if you ’ re wondering when a get should be used as opposed to a post , the answer has to do with a vocabulary lesson : defining the term idempotent . thrown about with http get , idempotent is a mathematical concept about an operation property : if the operation can be performed without changing results , even if it is run multiple times , it ’ s considered idempotent . therefore , if the input return is assured of having no lasting effect on the state of the form in total , then using a get is perfectly reasonable . also , a get can usually transfer only up to 8kb , whereas a post can usually handle up to 2gb . however , keep in mind it may wind up including sensitive information in that uri . suppose your form returns a credit card number and a bad guy is logging uris : if http get is in place , the attacker may be able to derive the information . in short , users can manipulate both get and post , but get is simply more visible because of its reliance on something that browsers render to the screen in an editable field . a post is meant for pushing data directly , and a get is used when the server is expected to pull something from the data submitted in the url ."
B,B,an attacker is looking at a target website and is viewing an account from the store on url url he next enters the following url : url and 1=1 the web page loads normally . he then enters the following url : url and 1=2 a generic page noting “ an error has occurred ” appears . which of the following is a correct statement concerning these actions ? a . the site is vulnerable to cross-site scripting . b . the site is vulnerable to blind sql injection . c. the site is vulnerable to buffer overflows . d. the site is not vulnerable to sql injection .,"the correct answer is b . the urls shown here are attempting to pass a sql query through to see what may be going on in the background . notice the first url entered added and 1=1 . because this was a true statement , the page loaded without problem . however , changing that to a false statement ( and 1=2 ) caused the database to return an error . this would now be considered “ blind ” sql injection because the actual error was not returned to the attacker ( instead , he got a generic page most likely configured by the database administrator ) . as an aside , sometimes the attacker won ’ t receive the error message or error page at all , but the site will be displayed differently—images out of place , text messed up , and so on—which also indicates blind sql may be in order ."
B,B,which of the following statements is not true regarding webgoat ? a. webgoat is maintained and made available by owasp . b. webgoat can be installed on windows systems only . c. webgoat is based on a black-box testing mentality . d. webgoat can use java or .net .,"the correct answer is b. webgoat , now in version 8.2.2 ( url category : owasp_webgoat_project ) , is a deliberately insecure web application maintained by owasp designed to teach web application security lessons . in each lesson , users must demonstrate their understanding of a security issue by exploiting a real vulnerability in the webgoat application . it ’ s designed to teach from a black-box mentality ( that is , learners aren ’ t provided with all information up front and must discover what they need to know to figure out each lesson , just as they ’ d have to do in the real world ) , can be installed on virtually anything , and makes use of java and .net ."
B,B,"an attacker is viewing a blog entry showing a news story and asking for comments . in the comment field , the attacker enters the following : nice post and a fun read < script > onload=window.location='url what is the attacker attempting to perform ? a . a sql injection attack against the blog ’ s underlying database b . a cross-site scripting attack c. a buffer overflow dos attack d. a file injection dos attack","the correct answer is b . this is a classic ( albeit overly simplified ) example of cross-site scripting . in a blog , the post entry field is intended to take text entry from a visitor and copy it to a database in the background . what ’ s being attempted here is to have more than just the text copied—the < script > indicator is adding a nice little pointer to a malicious website . if it works , the next visitor to the site who clicks that news story will be redirected to the bad site location ."
D,D,which of the following is one of the most common methods for an attacker to exploit the shellshock vulnerability ? a. ssh brute force b. csrf c. form field entry manipulation d. through web servers utilizing cgi ( common gateway interface ),"the correct answer is d. i would bet very large sums of cash you will see shellshock on your exam—maybe even a couple of times . shellshock ( also known as bashdoor ) exploits a feature in the bash shell designed to allow environmental variable setting configuration . basically , someone was playing around in bash back in 2014 and figured out they could add arbitrary commands to environmental variable configuration command-line submissions . if an attacker input something like env val= ' ( ) [ : ; } ; echo badcommand ' bash -c `` echo realcommand '' on a vulnerable system , badcommand would be executed before the real command . per symantec ( www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shellshock-all-you-need-knowabout-bash-bug-vulnerability ) , “ the most likely route of attack is through web servers utilizing cgi ( common gateway interface ) , the widely used system for generating dynamic web content . an attacker can potentially use cgi to send a malformed environment variable to a vulnerable web server . because the server uses bash to interpret the variable , it will also run any malicious command tacked on to it. ” other avenues for shellshock exploitation include the following : • openssh the “ force command ” function ( where a fixed command is run when a user logs on , even if the user requested a different command ) can be exploited in shellshock . • dhcp some dhcp clients have the capability of passing commands to the bash shell—for example , during connection to a wi-fi network . this can be exploited in shellshock . • qmail if bash is used to process e-mail messaging , the server processes external input in a way that can be exploited in bash ."
D,D,you are examining website files and find the following text file : # robots.txt for url user-agent : googlebot disallow : /tmp/ user-agent : * disallow : / disallow : /private.php disallow : /listing.html which of the following is a true statement concerning this file ? a . all web crawlers are prevented from indexing the listing.html page . b . all web crawlers are prevented from indexing all pages on the site . c. the googlebot crawler is allowed to index pages starting with /tmp/ . d. the googlebot crawler can access and index everything on the site except for pages starting with /tmp/ .,"the correct answer is d. the robots.txt file was created to allow web designers to control index access to their sites . there are a couple of things you need to know about this file—for your exam and the real world . the first is , no matter what the robots.txt file says , attackers using a crawler to index your site are going to ignore it anyway : it ’ s valid only for “ good-guy ” crawlers . after that , the rest is easy : robots.txt is stored on the root , is available to anyone ( by design ) , and is read in order from top to bottom , much like an acl on a router . the format is simple : define the crawler ( user-agent : name_ of_crawler ) , and then define what it does not have access to . most robot.txt files will make use of the * variable to signify all crawlers , but you can certainly get specific with who is allowed in and what they can see . in this example , from top to bottom , the googlebot crawler is defined and restricted from seeing /tmp/ pages—no other restrictions are listed . after that , all other crawlers ( user-agent : * ) are restricted from seeing any page ( disallow : / ) . the last two lines are truly irrelevant because the condition to ignore all pages has been read . for additional information here , if you think about what a robots.txt file does , you could consider it a pointer to pages you , as an attacker , really want to see . after all , if the security person on the site didn ’ t want google indexing it , useful information probably resides there . on the flip side , a security-minded person may get a little snippy with robots.txt and have a little fun , sending you to some truly terrible internet locations should you try to access one of the pages listed there ."
D,D,which of the following is a true statement ? a. kismet can be installed on windows but not on linux . b. netstumbler can be installed on linux but not on windows . c. kismet can not monitor traffic on 802.11n networks . d. netstumbler can not monitor traffic on 802.11n networks .,"the correct answer is d. not only is this question overly confusing and very tool specific , it ’ s pretty much exactly the type of question you ’ ll see on your exam . kismet and netstumbler are both wireless monitoring tools with detection and sniffing capabilities . netstumbler is windows specific , whereas kismet can be installed on virtually anything . both do a great job of monitoring 802.11a , b , and g networks , but netstumbler can ’ t handle 802.11n . kismet can even be used as an ids for your wireless network ! one last fun fact to know in relation to this question—kismet does a better job of pulling management packets . a lot of wireless cards on windows systems don ’ t support monitor mode and have a difficult time pulling management and control packets ."
"B,C","B,C",which of the following use a 48-bit initialization vector ? ( choose all that apply . ) a. wep b. wpa c. wpa2 d. wep2,"the correct answer is b , c. one of the improvements from wep to wpa involved extending the initialization vector ( iv ) to 48 bits from 24 bits . while this may seem like a simple doubling of options , you ’ ve got to remember each additional bit exponentially increases the keyspace . an iv provides for confidentiality and integrity . wireless encryption algorithms use it to calculate an integrity check value ( icv ) , appending it to the end of the data payload . the iv is then combined with a key to be input into an algorithm ( rc4 for wep , aes for wpa2 ) . therefore , because the length of an iv determines the total number of potential random values that can possibly be created for encryption purposes , doubling to 48 bits increased overall security . by itself , this didn ’ t answer all security problems—it only meant it took a little longer to capture enough iv packets to crack the code . however , combined with other steps , it did provide for better security ."
"B,D","B,D",which of the following are true statements ? ( choose all that apply . ) a. wep uses shared-key encryption with tkip . b. wep uses shared-key encryption with rc4 . c. wpa2 uses shared-key encryption with rc4 . d. wpa uses tkip and aes encryption .,"the correct answer is b , d. wep uses a 24-bit initialization vector and rc4 to “ encrypt ” data transmissions , although saying that makes me shake in disgust because it ’ s really a misnomer . wep was designed as basic encryption merely to simulate the “ security ” of being on a wired network—hence , the “ equivalent ” part in wired equivalent privacy . it was never intended as true encryption protection . wpa was an improvement on two fronts . first , the shared key portion of encryption was greatly enhanced by the use of temporal key integrity protocol ( tkip ) . in short , the key used to encrypt data was made temporary in nature and is swapped out every 10,000 packets or so . additionally , wpa2 uses nist-approved encryption with aes as the algorithm of choice ."
A,A,which of the following would you recommend as a means to deny network access by unauthorized wireless devices to network assets ? a. wireless access control list b. wireless jammer c. wireless analyzer d. wireless access point,"the correct answer is a . of the choices provided , the access control list is the only one that makes sense . this is what exactly what an access control list is designed for : by making sure only devices that are authorized can connect , you ensure unauthorized devices can not connect ( or at least take steps to avoid their connection ) . as a side note here , be careful not to confuse a wireless intrusion prevention system ( wips ) with the acl . a wips will monitor your traffic and , just like the better-known network intrusion prevention system , will take steps to prevent intrusion based on traffic analysis , thresholds , and alerts . lastly , on questions like this , the process of elimination can help you discern the answer pretty easily ."

B,B,"an attacker is attempting to crack a wep code to gain access to the network . after enabling monitor mode on wlan0 and creating a monitoring interface ( mon 0 ) , she types this command : aireplay –ng -0 0 –a 0a:00:2b:40:70:80 –c mon0 what is she trying to accomplish ? a . to gain access to the wep access code by examining the response to deauthentication packets , which contain the wep code b . to use deauthentication packets to generate lots of network traffic c. to determine the bssid of the access point d. to discover the cloaked ssid of the network","the correct answer is b . within 802.11 standards , there are several different management-type frames in use : everything from a beacon and association request to a probe request . one of these management frames is a deauthentication packet , which basically shuts off a client from the network . the client then has to reconnect—and will do so quickly . the idea behind this kind of activity is to generate lots of traffic to capture in order to discern the wep access code ( from clients trying to reassociate to all the new arp packets that will come flying around , since many machines will dump their arp cache after being shut off the network ) . remember that the initialization vectors within wep are relatively short ( 24 bits ) and are reused frequently , so any attempt to crack the code requires , in general , around 15,000 or so packets . you can certainly gather these over time , but generating traffic can accomplish it much faster . one final note on this must be brought up : this type of attack can just as easily result in a denial-of-service attack against hosts and the ap in question , so be careful ."
C,C,which wireless standard works at 54mbps on a frequency range of 2.4ghz ? a . 802.11a b . 802.11b c. 802.11g d. 802.11n,"the correct answer is c. the 802.11 series of standards identifies a variety of wireless issues , such as the order imposed on how clients communicate , rules for authentication , data transfer , size of packets , how the messages are encoded into the signal , and so on . 802.11g combines the advantages of both the “ a ” and “ b ” standards without as many of the drawbacks . it ’ s fast ( at 54mbps ) , is backward compatible with 802.11b clients , and doesn ’ t suffer from the coverage area restrictions 802.11a has to contend with . considering it operates in the 2.4ghz range , however , there may be some interference issues to deal with . not only is a plethora of competing networks blasting their signals ( sometimes on the same channel ) near and around your network , but you also have to consider bluetooth devices , cordless phones , and even baby monitors that may cause disruption ( due to interference ) of wireless signals . also , microwave ovens happen to run at 2.45ghz—right smack dab in the middle of the range ."

B,B,which of the tools listed here is a passive discovery tool ? a. aircrack b. kismet c. netstumbler d. netsniff,"the correct answer is b . a question like this one can be a little tricky , depending on its wording ; however , per the ec-council , kismet works as a true passive network discovery tool , with no packet interjection whatsoever . the following is from www.kismetwireless.net : “ kismet is an 802.11 layer 2 wireless network detector , sniffer , and intrusion detection system . kismet will work with any wireless card which supports raw monitoring ( rfmon ) mode , and ( with appropriate hardware ) can sniff 802.11b , 802.11a , 802.11g , and 802.11n traffic . kismet also supports plugins which allow sniffing other media. ” you might also see two other interesting notables about kismet on your exam : first , it works by channel hopping , attempting to discover as many networks as possible . second , it has the ability to sniff packets and save them to a log file , readable by wireshark or tcpdump ."
B,B,you have discovered an access point using wep for encryption purposes . which of the following is the best choice for uncovering the network key ? a. netstumbler b. aircrack c. john the ripper d. kismet,"the correct answer is b. aircrack is a fast tool for cracking wep ( assuming you ’ ve collected at least 50,000 packets or so , it ’ ll work swimmingly fast ) . you ’ ll need to gather a lot of packets using another toolset , but once you have them together , aircrack does a wonderful job cracking the key . one method aircrack uses that you may see referenced on the exam is korek implementation , which basically involves slicing bits out of packets and replacingthem with guesses—the more this is done , the better the guessing and , eventually , the faster the key is recovered . other tools for cracking wep include cain ( which can also use korek ) , kismac , wepcrack , and elcomsoft ’ s wireless security auditor tool ."

D,D,which iot communication model adds the ability for third parties to collect and use data ? a. device-to-device b. device-to-cloud c. device-to-gateway d. back-end data sharing,"the correct answer is d. even if you didn ’ t know a thing about iot communication models , this one had to be at least somewhat obvious . in the back-end data-sharing model , the device communicates directly via coap or http to the application service provider , and the data is then made available to third parties . as an aside , this method may or may not make use of an internal gateway ."
C,C,"which of the following statements is true regarding cloud computing ? a . in iaas , applications , data , middleware , virtualization , and servers are part of the service provision . b . in paas , applications , data , middleware , virtualization , and servers are part of the service provision . c. in saas , applications , data , middleware , virtualization , and servers are part of the service provision . d. none of the above .","the correct answer is c. so there are several things ec-council is very concerned that you know regarding cloud computing , but two in particular are right at the top of the list . the concepts of separation of duties and separation of responsibility—both of which are key aims and benefits of cloud computing—keep popping up over and over again in study materials and will be key to your success . separation of duties is a provision of all cloud computing types , but only one of the three takes care of everything . in software as a service ( saas ) , the service provider delivers the entirety of the span of responsibility . everything from applications and data through middleware and os , all the way down to the networking itself , is provided by the service provisioner . for comparison sake , in platform as a service ( paas ) , the service provider takes care of everything except the applications and data . in infrastructure as a service ( iaas ) , the client holds the applications , data , runtime , middleware , and os , while the provider takes care of everything else—virtualization , servers , storage , and networking ."
B,B,"which of the following statements is true regarding cloud computing ? a . in iaas , applications , data , middleware , virtualization , and servers are part of the questionsq service provision . b . in paas , applications , data , middleware , virtualization , and servers are part of the service provision . c. in saas , applications , data , middleware , virtualization , and servers are part of the service provision . d. none of the above .","the correct answer is b. ec-council , at least as of this writing , doesn ’ t mention one single regulatory effort in cloud computing at all , outside of nist ’ s reference architecture , in their official courseware . this does not mean you will not see any cloud computing regulatory efforts on your exam . i ’ m willing to bet you ’ ll see more and more of them as time goes on , and fedramp is the 800-pound gorilla of cloud computing regulatory efforts you absolutely need to know about . the federal risk and authorization management program ( fedramp ; www .fedramp.gov/ ) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment , authorization , and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services . it not only provides an auditable framework for ensuring basic security controls for any government cloud effort , but also offers weekly tips for security and configuration and even has free training available on the site . fedramp is the result of close collaboration with cybersecurity and cloud experts from the general services administration ( gsa ) , national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) , department of homeland security ( dhs ) , department of defense ( dod ) , national security agency ( nsa ) , office of management and budget ( omb ) , the federal chief information officer ( cio ) council and its working groups , as well as private industry ."
C,C,"a business owner is advised that inventory , storage , sales , and backup online services can be provided less expensively and more securely via a cloud service . after investigating the options , the business owner determines the best cloud service provider for his needs also happens to be the provider for several of his competitors . should he decide to engage the same provider , which cloud service deployment model will be used ? a . private b. multi-cloud c. community d. public","the correct answer is c. in most circumstances , it doesn ’ t matter who else uses the cloud provider you want to use—what matters is the services provided , the costs , and the available security . a community cloud model is one where the infrastructure is shared by several organizations , usually with the same policy and compliance considerations . for example , multiple different state-level organizations may get together and take advantage of a community cloud for services they require . or , in this case , even adversarial competitors may make use of the same services from the same cloud provider ."
B,B,"in “ nist cloud computing reference architecture , ” which of the following is the intermediary for providing connectivity between the cloud and the subscriber ? a . cloud provider b . cloud carrier c. cloud broker d. cloud auditor","the correct answer is b. i can guarantee you ’ ll see several questions from the cloud world on your exam , and many of those questions will be simply identifying portions of “ nist cloud computing reference architecture. ” the cloud carrier is defined in the architecture as the organization with the responsibility of transferring the data—akin to the power distributor for the electric grid . the cloud carrier is the intermediary for connectivity and transport between the subscriber and provider ."
C,C,"a company relies on a private cloud solution for most of its internal computing needs . after expanding into more online retailing , it relies on a portion of a public cloud for external sales and e-commerce offerings . which of the following best describes the cloud deployment type in use ? a . private b . public c. hybrid d. community",the correct answer is c. a hybrid cloud deployment is exactly what is sounds like—a combination of two or more deployment types together .
D,D,cloud computing would be best suited for which of the following businesses ? a . a medical practice b . an established rural general sales store c. a law enforcement agency d. a christmas supply store,"the correct answer is d. scenario questions like this will be peppered throughout your exam on multiple topics , and cloud computing is no different . in this case , the christmas supply store is , by its very nature , seasonal . this means instead of a steady flow of business and computing resources , it will need much more support during the last couple months of the year than it would in , say , july . cloud computing provides the elasticity ( another term you may see pop up ) of adding or removing computing resources as you need them , which could very well save the company money ."
B,B,a software company has decided to build and test web applications in a cloud computing environment . which of the following cloud computing types best describes this effort ? a. iaas b. paas c. saas d. community,"the correct answer is b . this scenario is tailor-made for platform as a service ( paas ) . despite also being a name brand recognized mostly during easter for coloring eggs , paas is geared toward software development , as it provides a platform that allows subscribers to create applications without building the infrastructure it would normally take to develop and launch software . hardware and software are hosted by the provider on its own infrastructure , so customers do not have to install or build homegrown hardware and software for development work . paas doesn ’ t usually replace an organization ’ s actual infrastructure ; instead , it just offers key services the organization may not have onsite ."
C,C,which of the following statements is not true ? a . private cloud is operated solely for a single organization . b . public cloud makes use of virtualized servers . c. public cloud is operated over an intranet . d. private cloud makes use of virtualized servers .,"the correct answer is c. most of the time i deplore the “ not ” questions—they seem designed to trip candidates up more than to test their knowledge—but virtually all certification providers make use of them often . in this case , a private cloud is , of course , operated solely for one organization , and virtualization is used in all cloud deployment models . a public cloud , however , explicitly provides services on a network that is open for public use ( like the internet ) ."
A,A,"a company relies solely on google docs , google sheets , and other cloud-based provisions for its office documentation software needs . which of the following cloud computing types best describes this ? a. saas b. paas c. iaas d. public","the correct answer is a . this scenario aptly describes software as a service . saas is a software distribution model—the provider offers on-demand applications to subscribers over the internet . google docs and google sheets , where word processing and spreadsheet software actions are provided online , are perfect examples . microsoft is also big in the saas game , and office 365 is seemingly taking over for the traditional microsoft office suite . instead of installing it on your system or buying it preinstalled at best buy ( or whatever vendor you use ) , you can “ rent ” office 365—get what you need for as long as you need . given that office is the world ’ s leading office productivity software , it shouldn ’ t come as a surprise that office 365 is a big hit . the u.s. air force , for one example , moved over half a million e-mail accounts to office 365 in january of 2019 ."
A,A,a subscriber purchases machine virtualization and hosting through amazon ec2 . which of the following cloud computing types does this describe ? a. iaas b. paas c. saas d. hybrid,"the correct answer is a . there are three types of cloud computing implementation : iaas , paas , and saas . in the case of amazon ec2 , infrastructure as a service best matches the description . iaas basically provides virtualized computing resources over the internet . a thirdparty provider hosts infrastructure components , applications , and services on behalf of its subscribers , with a hypervisor ( such as vmware , oracle virtualbox , xen , or kvm ) running the virtual machines as guests . collections of hypervisors within the cloud provider exponentially increase the virtualized resources available and provide scalability of service to subscribers . as a result , iaas is a good choice , not just for day-to-day infrastructure service , but also for temporary or experimental workloads that may change unexpectedly . iaas subscribers typically pay on a per-use basis ( within a certain timeframe , for instance ) or sometimes by the amount of virtual machine space used ."
"A,C","A,C",which of the following are true statements regarding containers and virtualization ? ( choose two . ) a. virtualization runs multiple operating systems on a single physical system . b. virtualization leverages multiple physical systems to create virtual operating systems . c. containers are placed on a single physical system and os . d. multiple containers require multiple operating systems on the host device . e. containers and virtual machines are the same thing .,"the correct answer is a , c. i can virtually guarantee you ’ ll see comparisons of containers and virtual machines on your exam , and because the wording in their definitions is so close , it ’ s easy to get them confused . the main difference to keep in mind between the two is that containers share the os of the system they ’ re on , whereas vms are their own separate entities with their own oss . virtually speaking , think of a container as a package and a vm as a complete system . a container holds all the components necessary for an application to run , and it relies on the underlying os to host . a vm is a complete virtual system , with its own operating system ."
A,A,which of the following attacks occurs during the translation of soap messages ? a. wrapping attack b. cross-guest vm c. side channel d. session riding,"the correct answer is a . attacks aren ’ t necessarily specific to cloud computing , but ec-council covers wrapping attacks here , so we ’ ll follow suit . in a wrapping attack , the user sends a request to the server , but the soap response is intercepted by the attacker . he then duplicates the original message and sends it as if he is the user . in short , to pull this off , you just intercept the response , change the data in the soap envelope , and replay ."
B,B,"which of the following is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol , typically over a network ? a. api b. soa c. ec2 d. iaas","the correct answer is b . in service-oriented architecture ( soa ) , software is designed where each of the individual components works and communicates with components on different systems across the network . each computer can run any of the services in the software , and each individual component is built so that it can exchange information with any other service in the network , without interaction or the need to make changes to the software . for example , someone might create an api that provides access to a database , which then allows third-party vendors to create their own applications to take advantage of it ."
A,A,"in “ nist cloud computing reference architecture , ” which entity manages cloud services and maintains the relationship between cloud providers and subscribers ? a . cloud broker b . cloud auditor c. cloud carrier d. cloud consumer","the correct answer is a . “ nist cloud computing reference architecture ” defines the cloud broker as the entity that acts to manage the use , performance , and delivery of cloud services , as well as the relationships between providers and subscribers . the broker “ acts as the intermediate between consumer and provider and will help consumers through the complexity of cloud service offerings and may also create value-added cloud services as well . ”"
D,D,"which of the following is not a benefit of virtualization ? a . it allows for more efficient backup , data protection , and disaster recovery . b . it reduces system administration work . c. it improves operational efficiency . d. it locks individual hardware to each individual virtual machine .","the correct answer is d. some of you may actually work with and in a cloud , and you may disagree with at least one of the benefits listed here . however , while there may be differences between the real world and your ceh exam , for your test you really need to know the benefits of virtualization . the idea itself is great—run one or more operating systems simultaneously on the same physical box by virtualizing the hardware to each os . multiple companies ( such as vmware , oracle virtualbox , and xen ) provide the hypervisor ( aka virtual machine monitor , or vmm , which is an application or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines ) that allows multiple oss to share the same physical machine hardware . virtualizing your server can improve operational efficiency , provide for more efficient backups , offer disaster recovery and data protection , and reduce administrative work . additionally , virtualization may have a positive effect on ensuring control and compliance throughout the network , as well as reduce overall costs ."
D,D,a company acquires a cloud environment for much of its business it needs . the environment is used and operated solely for the single organization . which of the following represents the cloud deployment model in question ? a . public b. iaas c. sole source d. private,"the correct answer is d. in a private cloud model , the cloud is operated solely for a single organization ( aka single-tenant environment ) and is usually not a type of pay-as-you-go operation . private clouds are usually preferred by larger organizations because the hardware is dedicated and security and compliance requirements can be more easily met ."
C,C,which of the following statements is true regarding cloud computing ? a . security in the cloud is the responsibility of the provider only . b . security in the cloud is the responsibility of the consumer only . c. security in the cloud is the responsibility of both the consumer and the provider . d. none of the above .,"the correct answer is c. one of the biggest misconceptions about cloud computing seems to be where the lines of responsibility are drawn . however , it should come as no surprise that security is everyone ’ s responsibility , and that absolutely extends to the cloud . the provider must protect the hardware , virtualization , vms , and network connectivity . the consumer must protect their virtual systems ( oss , applications , and data ) . sometimes this is a challenge in the real world . where does your testing start and end ? if your entire system relies on a cloud provider to remain up and secure , can you test all of it ? and what happens if your resources are comingled somewhere inside all that cloud secret sauce ? can you really trust they ’ re on top of things , security-wise ? should you ? can you ? and lastly , remember that whatever issues you had before migrating to the cloud won ’ t magically disappear once you ’ ve migrated . in effect , “ you take your problems with you , ” as my humble tech editor is known to say , so all those app vulnerabilities , authentication problems , and other technical ( and especially administrative ) problems are still yours to deal with , whether you ’ re in the cloud or not ."
C,C,which tool offers penetration-test-like services for amazon ec2 customers ? a. cloudpassage halo b . core cloud c. cloudinspect d. panda cloud office protection,"the correct answer is c. cloudinspect ( www.coresecurity.com/corelabs-research/projects/core-cloudinspect ) is “ a tool that profits from the core impact & core insight technologies to offer penetration-testing as a service from amazon web services for ec2 users. ” it ’ s obviously designed for aws cloud subscribers and runs as an automated , all-in-one testing suite specifically for your cloud subscription ."
A,A,an attacker sets up a vm on the same physical cloud host as the target ’ s vm . he then takes advantage of the shared physical resources to steal data . which of the following describes this attack ? a . side channel b. vm flood c. session riding d. cybersquatting,"the correct answer is a . the side-channel attack , also known as a cross-guest vm breach , occurs when an attacker gets a virtual machine on the same host as the target . through a variety of means for taking advantage of vulnerabilities in some shared technologies , the attacker then uses the shared physical resources to pilfer data . providers can mitigate these attacks by using an up-to-date hypervisor provision , implementing strong virtual firewalls between guest oss , and enforcing the use of encryption . subscribers can help by locking down ( hardening ) their oss and using good coding in their applications ( especially when it comes to accessing resources such as memory ) . as a fun aside , these types of attacks are categorized by people who actually pen test for a living as a unicorn attack—since you ’ ll have as good a chance seeing a unicorn as you will actually performing this attack ."
B,B,"which of the following is a container orchestration platform created by google to automate creating , managing , scaling , and deleting containers ? a. docker b. kubernetes c. microservices d. serverless computing","the correct answer is b. kubernetes ( also known as k8s ) is a container orchestration platform . if you happen to install multiple docker containers on multiple hosts with different operating systems , kubernetes can bring them all together in one management platform . kubernetes is open source , portable and extensible , and can be installed virtually anywhere . features include , but are not limited to , service discovery , load balancing , storage allocation , rollouts , rollbacks , and configuration management ."

D,D,you have established a netcat connection to a target machine . which flag can be used to launch a program ? a . -p b . -a c. -l d. -e,"the correct answer is d. netcat is often referred to as the swiss army knife of hacking efforts . you can use it to set up a listening port on target machines that you can then revisit to wreak all sorts of havoc . the flag associated with launching a program is -e. for example , issuing the command nc –l –p 12657 –t –e cmd.exe will open a windows command shell on the target machine ; the -t flag sets up a telnet connection over the port you defined with the -p flag ( 12657 ) ."
B,B,"claire is surfing the web and , after some time , a message pops up stating her system has been infected by malware and offering a button to click for removal of the virus . after she clicks the button , another message window appears stating the system has been quarantined due to the nature of the infection and provides a link with instructions to pay in order to regain control and to clear the virus . which of the following best describes this infection ? a. spyware b. ransomware c. trojan d. adware","the correct answer is b . the name ransomware gives away its purpose : the malware infects your system and then restricts access to your files and folders , demanding a ransom payment to get control back . ecc lists five different ransomware families : cryptorbit , cryptolocker , cryptodefense , cryptowall , and police-themed . usually the online payment involves bitcoin , but it can take other avenues . in any case , never pay off the attacker—you ’ re only signing yourself up for future terror . cleaning off ransomware may involve booting into safe mode , or even using a system restore on windows systems . you may even get away with an external av scan as a fix action , but be sure to scrub the system for hidden files and folders the ransomware may have left behind . lastly , i can ’ t overstate enough the value of good , solid , dependable backups . even if you ’ re foolish enough to pay the ransom , there is no guarantee any of your files will remain accessible after the “ unlock ” —and could you trust them anyway ? invest in good backups and run them religiously ."
A,A,"matty is examining malware as part of a security effort . she performs analysis of the malware executable without running or installing it . instead , she examines source and binary code to find data structures , function calls , and other indicators of malicious behavior . which of the following best describes the type of malware analysis matty is performing ? a. static b . dynamic c. file fingerprinting d. code emulation","the correct answer is a. ec-council defines two main types of malware analysis—static and dynamic . in static analysis , the examiner never actually installs or executes the malware . it ’ s considered a “ safe ” analysis , as the suspect file isn ’ t installed or allowed to execute ; however , as this is obviously a touchy area , it ’ s always a best and recommended practice to perform analysis in a closed environment . this is largely a manual process , but there are static analysis tools that can assist ."
C,C,pen test team member amy attempts to guess the isn for a tcp session . which attack is she most likely carrying out ? a. xss b . session splicing c. session hijacking d. multipartite attack,"the correct answer is c. the idea behind session hijacking is fairly simple : the attacker waits for a session to begin and , after all the pesky authentication gets done , jumps in to steal the session for herself . in practice , it ’ s a little harder and more complicated than that , but the key to the whole attack is in determining the initial sequence number ( isn ) used for the session . the isn is sent by the initiator of the session in the first step ( syn ) . this is acknowledged in the second step of the handshake ( syn/ack ) by incrementing that isn by 1 , and then another isn is generated by the recipient . this second number is acknowledged by the initiator in the third step ( ack ) , and from there on out communication can occur . per ec-council , the following steps describe the session hijack : 1 . sniff the traffic between the client and the server . 2 . monitor the traffic and predict the sequence numbering . 3 . desynchronize the session with the client . 4 . predict the session token and take over the session . 5 . inject packets to the target server . for what it ’ s worth , pulling this attack off via ec-council ’ s take on the whole matter requires you to do some fairly significant traffic sniffing . and if you ’ re already positioned to sniff the traffic in the first place , wouldn ’ t the whole scenario possibly be a moot point ? you need to know it for the exam , but real-world application may be rare ."
C,C,an attacker wants to make his malware as stealthy and undetectable as possible . he employs an effort that uses compression to reduce the file size of the malware . which of the following best describes this ? a. crypter b. wrapper c. packer d. compressor,"the correct answer is c. a packer uses compression to pack the malware executable into a smaller size . not only does this reduce the file size , but it serves to make the malware harder to detect for some antivirus engines . while it can be compared to a zip file , there are differences . for one example , the extraction occurs in memory and not on the disk . but the primary difference between a packer and a general compression routine like .zip is that a packer inflates/restores at runtime and on binary files ( versus the more generic compression offered by .zip ) ."
D,D,which of the following best describes a type of network attack whereby an attacker gains access to your network and remains undetected for a long time period ? a. fileless malware b. zombie c. fraggle d. apt,"the correct answer is d. nist defines advanced persistent threat ( apt ) this way : “ an adversary with sophisticated levels of expertise and significant resources , allowing it through the use of multiple different attack vectors ( e.g. , cyber , physical , and deception ) to generate opportunities to achieve its objectives , which are typically to establish and extend footholds within the information technology infrastructure of organizations for purposes of continually exfiltrating information and/or to undermine or impede critical aspects of a mission , program , or organization , or place itself in a position to do so in the future ; moreover , the advanced persistent threat pursues its objectives repeatedly over an extended period of time , adapting to a defender ’ s efforts to resist it , and with determination to maintain the level of interaction needed to execute its objectives. ” i don ’ t know about you , but that wall of text reminds me of the agreement contract you have to accept before using your iphone . what this really means is apts are bad guys ( oftentimes well-funded , nation-state attackers ) who have found a way into your systems and have stayed around for a long time . apts are a nightmare from an incident response ( ir ) position , as tracking down the initial attack vector , how long they ’ ve been around , and how much they ’ ve had access to is next to impossible ."
A,A,an attacker makes use of the beacon implant on a target system to hijack a browser session . which of the following best describes this attack ? a . man in the browser b . man in the middle c. man in the pivot d. ie hijacking,"the correct answer is a . most have heard of session hijacking and man in the middle , but what about man in the browser ? a man-in-the-browser ( mitb ) attack occurs when the hacker sends a trojan to intercept browser calls . the trojan basically sits between the browser and libraries , allowing a hacker to watch , and interact within , a browser session . cobalt strike—created by raphael mudge—added this feature a couple years back . if you have his beacon ( the name of his implant ) on a box , you can “ browser pivot ” such that all of the target ’ s active sessions become your own . all of them . it effectively sets up a local proxy port so you can point your browser to it , and it directs all your requests through the beacon on the target machine . now you ’ re browsing in your own browser as the target , without them even knowing it ."
"A,C,D","A,C,D","claire ’ s windows system at work begins displaying strange activity , and she places a call to the it staff . on investigation , it appears claire ’ s system is infected with several viruses . the it staff removes the viruses by deleting several file and folder locations and using an av tool and then reconnects the machine to the network . later in the day , claire ’ s system again displays strange activity and the it staff is called once again . which of the following are likely causes of the reinfection ? ( choose all that apply . ) a. claire revisits a malicious website . b. claire opens her microsoft outlook e-mail client and newly received e-mail is loaded to her local folder ( .pst file ) . c. claire uses a system restore point to regain access to deleted files and folders . d. claire uses the organization ’ s backup application to restore files and folders .","the correct answer is a , c , d. virus removal can be tricky , especially if nobody knows how and when the virus got on the system in the first place . as a matter of fact , in many places i ’ ve worked , discovering the source of the virus is as important as cleaning the system in the first place . cleaning a virus off the system usually involves scrubbing the microsoft registry , deleting files and folders ( don ’ t forget to check for hidden ones ) , and a host of other details and actions . sometimes av removal applications can help with this process , but sometimes it ’ s an involved , manual process . even with tools to help in removal , administrators can ’ t afford to overlook system restore points , backups , and user behavior . if a virus is on a system during a system restore copy action , then any restoration of that point will reinstall the virus . the same thing goes for data backups themselves—it should follow that an infected file while being backed up will remain infected during the restore action . as for user behavior , if the user is re-infected immediately following a specific website visit , or after using a usb ( or other removable media ) , at least you can pinpoint the source and hopefully stop it from happening again ."
B,B,"in regard to trojans , which of the following best describes a wrapper ? a . the legitimate file the trojan is attached to b . a program used to bind the trojan to a legitimate file c. a method of obfuscation using compression d. a software tool that uses encryption and code manipulation to hide malware","the correct answer is b. wrappers are programs that allow you to bind an executable of your choice ( trojan ) to an innocent file your target won ’ t mind opening . for example , you might use a program such as elitewrap to embed a backdoor application with a game file ( .exe ) . a user on your target machine then opens the latest game file ( maybe to play a hand of cards against the computer or to fling a bird at pyramids built by pigs ) while your backdoor is installing and sits there waiting for your use later . as an aside , many wrappers themselves are considered malicious and will show up on any up-to-date virus signature list ."

A,A,which of the following is a legitimate communication path for the transfer of data ? a . overt b . covert c. authentic d. imitation e. actual,"the correct answer is a . this is another one of those easy , pure-definition questions you simply can ’ t miss on your exam . whether it ’ s inside a computer , between systems , or across the internet , any legitimate channel used for communications and data exchange is known as an overt channel . and don ’ t let the inherit risk with any channel itself make the decision for you—even if the channel itself is a risky endeavor , if it is being used for its intended purpose , it ’ s still overt . for example , an irc or a gaming link is still an overt channel , so long as the applications making use of it are legitimate . overt channels are legitimate communication channels used by programs across a system or a network , whereas covert channels are used to transport data in ways they were not intended for ."
B,B,in what layer of the osi reference model is session hijacking carried out ? a . data link layer b . transport layer c. network layer d. physical layer,"the correct answer is b . if you think about a session hijack , this makes sense . authentication has already occurred , so we know both computers have already found each other . therefore , the physical , data link , and network layers have already been eclipsed . and what is being altered and played with in these hijacking attempts ? why , the sequence numbers , of course , and sequencing occurs at the transport layer . now , for all you real-world folks out there screaming that communications can be , and truly are , hijacked at every level , let me caution your outrage with something i ’ ve said repeatedly throughout this book : sometimes the exam and reality are two different things , and if you want to pass the test , you ’ ll need to memorize this the way ec-council wants you to . session hijacking is taught in ceh circles as a measure of guessing sequence numbers , and that ’ s a transport layer entity . in the real world , your physical layer interception of a target would result in access to everything above , but on the exam just stick with “ session hijacking = transport layer . ”"

A,A,which of the following is a true statement ? a. sequence prediction attacks are specific to tcp . b . using a protocol in a way it is not intended to be used is an example of an overt channel . c. all dos and ddos attacks are specific to tcp . d. fraggle is a tcp-based attack .,"the correct answer is a. sequence prediction attacks are specific to tcp because tcp uses sequence numbers . unlike the fire-and-forget method employed by udp , tcp uses sequence numbers and windowing to keep track of conversations . sequence prediction is a session hijacking procedure where the attacker guesses the next sequence number and launches himself into the data connection between client and server ."
B,B,which denial-of-service attack involves using multiple intermediary and secondary machines to contribute to the dos effort ? a. syn flood b. drdos c. application-level flood d. loic,"the correct answer is b . a distributed reflection denial-of-service ( drdos ) attack is also known as a “ spoofed ” attack and makes use of multiple intermediary and secondary machines . the bad guy sends attack information to the intermediary machines , which , in turn , send the messages out to the secondary machines . this makes tracking the real source of the attack very difficult to determine ( the investigators will see and react to the secondaries , not the originator ) ."
A,A,which of the following best describes malware that infects legitimate software using existing vulnerabilities to carry out malicious activities ? a. fileless malware b . apt c. dynamic analysis d. ping of death,"the correct answer is a . in reading about fileless malware , i came across a description that said it was also known as “ non-malware. ” while that did elicit a chuckle from me , the real point in it is very true : fileless malware isn ’ t necessarily like a virus or trojan you can find , examine , and block with an av system . fileless malware is an effort to leverage existing vulnerabilities to get legitimate services on your system to carry out the bad guy ’ s wishes . residing in ram , fileless malware injects code into all sorts of running processes ."
A,A,ipsec is an effective preventative measure against session hijacking . which ipsec mode encrypts only the data payload ? a . transport b . tunnel c. protected d. spoofed,"the correct answer is a. ipsec is a wonderful encryption mechanism that can rather easily be set up between two endpoints or even across your entire subnet if you configure the hosts appropriately . you won ’ t need to know all the bells and whistles with ipsec for the exam ( and thank goodness , because there ’ s a lot to write about ) , but you do need to know the basics . transport mode does not affect the header of the packet at all and encrypts only the payload . it ’ s typically used as a secured connection between two endpoints , whereas tunnel mode creates a vpn-like connection protecting the entire session . additionally , transport mode is compatible with conventional network address translation ( nat ) ."
D,D,what provides for both authentication and confidentiality in ipsec ? a. ah b. ike c. oakley d. esp,"the correct answer is d. encapsulation security payload ( esp ) is a member of the ipsec protocol suite , and it provides data authentication ( proving the data is actually from who it ’ s supposed to be from ) and confidentiality ( by encrypting the data ) . in transport mode , esp doesn ’ t provide integrity and authentication for the entirety of the packet , but it does in tunnel mode ( excluding the outer ip header , of course )"
C,C,"which of the following statements best describes the comparison between spoofing and session hijacking ? a. spoofing and session hijacking are the same thing . b. spoofing interrupts a client ’ s communication , whereas hijacking does not . c. hijacking interrupts a client ’ s communication , whereas spoofing does not . d. hijacking emulates a foreign ip address , whereas spoofing refers to mac addresses .","the correct answer is c. hijacking and spoofing can sometimes be confused with each other , although they really shouldn ’ t be . spoofing refers to a process where the attacking machine pretends to be something it is not . whether by faking a mac address or an ip address , the idea is that other systems on the network will communicate with your machine ( that is , set up and tear down sessions ) as if it ’ s the target system . generally this is used to benefit sniffing efforts . hijacking is a totally different animal . in hijacking , the attacker jumps into an already existing session , knocking the client out of it and fooling the server into continuing the exchange . in many cases , the client will simply reconnect to the server over a different session , with no one the wiser : the server isn ’ t even aware of what happened , and the client simply connects again in a different session . as an aside , ec-council describes session hijacking as using these steps : 1 . sniff the traffic between the client and the server . 2 . monitor the traffic and predict the sequence numbering . 3 . desynchronize the session with the client . 4 . predict the session token and take over the session . 5 . inject packets to the target server ."
D,D,which of the following is an effective deterrent against tcp session hijacking ? a . install and use an hids on the system . b . install and use tripwire on the system . c. enforce good password policy . d. use unpredictable sequence numbers .,"the correct answer is d. as noted already , session hijacking requires the attacker to guess the proper upcoming sequence number ( s ) to pull off the attack , pushing the original client out of the session . using unpredictable session ids ( or , better stated in the real world , using a modern operating system with less predictable sequence numbers ) in the first place protects against this . other countermeasures for session hijacking are fairly common sense : use encryption to protect the channel , limit incoming connections , minimize remote access , and regenerate the session key after authentication is complete . and , lastly , don ’ t forget user education : if the users don ’ t know any better , they might not think twice about clicking past the security certificate warning or reconnecting after being suddenly shut down ."
A,A,which of the following is a group of internet computers set up to forward transmissions to other computers on the internet without the owner ’ s knowledge or permission ? a. botnet b. zombie c. honeypot d. ddos,"the correct answer is a . a botnet is a group of systems an attacker has control over , without the owner ’ s knowledge or permission . each zombie system in the network sends messages and data transmissions for the botnet controller—everything from spam and e-mail to viruses and ads . although they are probably best known for their roles in distributed denial-of-service attacks , botnets can be used for a variety of activities . as an aside , ecc maintains that botnets are most commonly controlled via irc ( internet relay chat ) , but in the real world they can be controlled by a host of methods ."
C,C,which of the following best describes a process for discovering the hash value for a given binary code ? a . string searching b . dependency walking c. file fingerprinting d. port monitoring,"the correct answer is c. file fingerprinting is a function in malware analysis where binary code is run through a hash to generate an identifying value . this can then be used to identify other malware packages , or see if any changes are made to the one you ’ re examining ."
C,C,when is session hijacking performed ? a . before the three-step handshake b . during the three-step handshake c. after the three-step handshake d. after a fin packet,"the correct answer is c. this question should be an easy one for you , but it ’ s included here to reinforce the point that you need to understand session hijacking steps well for the exam . of course , session hijacking should occur after the three-step handshake . as a matter of fact , you ’ ll probably need to wait quite a bit after the three-step handshake so that everything on the session can be set up—authentication and all that nonsense should be taken care of before you jump in and take over ."

C,C,a person approaches a network administrator and wants advice on how to send encrypted e-mail from home . the end user does not want to have to pay for any license fees or manage server services . which of the following offers a method for sending encrypted e-mail without having to pay for license fees or manage a server ? a. ip security ( ipsec ) b. multipurpose internet mail extensions ( mime ) c. pretty good privacy ( pgp ) d. hypertext transfer protocol with secure socket layer ( https ),"the correct answer is c. at this point , i ’ m pretty sure you understand that sometimes things on your ceh exam simply don ’ t match up with reality . this question is a prime example . ec-council , and their documentation up through version 8 , defines pretty good privacy ( pgp ) as a free , open source , e-mail encryption method available for all to use . in truth , pgp is now synonymous with a single company ’ s offering , based on the original pgp . the true open source , free side of it now is known more as openpgp ( www.openpgp.org/ ) . openpgp uses a decentralized system of trusted introducers that act in the same way as a certificate authority . basically , in this web-of-trust relationship , if user a signs user b ’ s certificate , then anyone who trusts user a will also trust user b . you can find downloads for software still using the free , open pgp at www.pgpi.org/ ."
A,A,which of the following is best defined as an encryption protocol commonly used for e-mail security ? a. pgp b. keyczar c. rsa d. md5,"the correct answer is a . even though it ’ s probably best known as an e-mail security protocol/application , pretty good privacy ( pgp ) can be used for a variety of purposes . pgp is used for encryption and decryption of messaging ( including e-mail ) , data compression , digital signing , and even whole disk encryption . it provides authentication and privacy as well as combines conventional and public key cryptography . don ’ t get this confused with s/mime . secure/multipurpose internet mail extensions ( s/mime ) is a standards-based protocol that can also encrypt messages ; however , it does not provide many of the other features pgp offers ( most importantly , whole disk encryption ) ."
D,D,"you ’ re describing a basic pki system to a new member of the team . he asks how the public key can be distributed within the system in an orderly , controlled fashion so that the users can be sure of the sender ’ s identity . which of the following would be your answer ? a . digital signature b. hash value c. private key d. digital certificate e. nonrepudiation","the correct answer is d. this one is actually easy , yet it is confusing to a lot of folks . you have to remember the goal of this little portion of a pki system—how does one know this public key really belongs to user joe and not user mike , and how can it be delivered safely to everyone ? a digital certificate is the answer because it contains the sender ’ s public key and can be used to identify the sender . because the ca provides the certificate and key ( public ) , the user can be certain the public key actually belongs to the intended recipient . this simplifies distribution of keys as well , because users can go to a central authority—a key store , if you will—instead of directly to each user in the organization . without central control and digital certificates , it would be a madhouse , with everyone chucking public keys at one another with wild abandon . and pki is no place for mardi gras , my friend ."
D,D,"after tls had largely replaced ssl for secure communications , many browsers retained backward compatibility to ssl 3.0 . which vulnerability takes advantage of the degradation of service down to ssl 3.0 in the tls handshake ? a. heartbleed b. freak c. drown d. poodle","the correct answer is d. poodle ( padding oracle on downgraded legacy encryption ) was discovered by google ’ s security team and announced to the public on october 14 , 2014 . this time it was a case of backward compatibility being a problem . many browsers would revert to ssl 3.0 when a tls connection was unavailable , and because tls performs a handshake effort designed to degrade service until something acceptable ( that is , a degraded encryption both sides can use ) is found , if a hacker could jump in the connection between client and server , he could interfere with these handshakes , making them all fail . this would result in the client dropping all the way to ssl 3.0 . ssl 3.0 has a design flaw that allows the padding data at the end of a block cipher to be changed so that the encryption cipher becomes less secure each time it is passed . if the same secret—let ’ s say a password—is sent over several sessions , more and more information about it will leak . eventually the connection may as well be plain text , and the attacker sitting in the middle can see everything . mitigation for poodle is simple—don ’ t use ssl 3.0 anywhere ."
D,D,which mode of ipsec is most often chosen for internal communications ? a. ah b. esp c. tunnel d. transport,"the correct answer is d. ipsec is a network layer encryption protocol that can be used in two modes : tunnel and transport . in transport mode , the data payload is encrypted but the rest of the packet ( the ip header in particular ) is not touched . this works well internally , between end stations , or between an end station and a gateway , if the gateway is being treated as a host . nat is not supported by transport mode , although it can be combined with other tunneling p"
B,B,"an organization is concerned about corporate espionage and has evidence suggesting an internal employee has been communicating trade secrets to a competitor . after some investigation , the employee leaking secrets was identified . monitoring of the employee ’ s previous communications outside the company revealed nothing out of the ordinary , save for some large unencrypted e-mails containing image files of humorous pictures to external addresses . which of the following is the most logical conclusion based on these facts ? a. e-mail encryption allowed the user to hide files . b . the user hid information in the image files using steganography . c. logical watermarking of images and e-mails fed the sensitive files piece by piece to the competitor . d. smtp transport fuzzing was used .","the correct answer is b . in this circumstance , you know the employee has been sending sensitive documents out of the network . the ids obviously hasn ’ t picked up on anything , and there was nothing overtly done to give away the intent . the only thing out of the ordinary turned out to be large e-mail files holding nothing but images . given the answers provided , steganography is the most logical choice , and the user simply folded the sensitive data into the latest joke image he found and sent it on its merry way ."

B,B,which encryption algorithm uses variable block sizes ( from 32 to 128 bits ) ? a. sha-1 b. rc5 c. 3des d. aes,"the correct answer is b . questions on identifying encryption algorithms really come down to memorization of some key terms . rivest cipher ( rc ) encompasses several versions , from rc2 through rc6 . it is an asymmetric block cipher that uses a variable key length up to 2040 bits . rc6 , the latest version , uses 128-bit blocks , whereas rc5 uses a variable block size ( 32 , 64 , or 128 ) ."
C,C,which hash algorithm was developed by the nsa and produces output values up to 512 bits ? a. md5 b. sha-1 c. sha-2 d. ssl,"the correct answer is c. both sha-1 and sha-2 were developed by the nsa ; however , sha-1 produced only a 160-bit output value . sha-2 was developed to rectify the shortcomings of its predecessor and is capable of producing outputs of 224 , 256 , 384 , and 512 bits . although it was designed as a replacement for sha-1 ( which was supposed to have been phased out in 2010 ) , sha-2 is still not as widely used . as an aside , sha-3 can produce 512-bit keys as well ."
D,D,you are concerned about protecting data on your organization ’ s laptops from loss or theft . which of the following technologies best accomplishes this goal ? a . single sign-on b . cloud computing c. ipsec tunnel mode d. full disk encryption,"the correct answer is d. data-at-rest ( dar ) protection is a security technology tailor-made for loss and theft protection , with one tiny little catch : full disk encryption in dar sets up a preboot session that requires valid credentials to unlock the machine . however , it ’ s important to note the preboot session will only engage after a full system power down . if the user just closes the lid and puts the machine into sleep mode , dar protection does nothing . assuming the user does power off the machine before taking it on a trip , preboot protects everything—including the master boot record—and ensures that even if the laptop is stolen or lost , the data inside is protected . if the user doesn ’ t power off , then dar is just another security tool that provides the illusion of security—which may be even worse than having nothing at all ."

D,D,"bit streams are run through an xor operation . which of the following is a true statement for each bit pair regarding this function ? a . if the first value is 0 and the second value is 1 , then the output is 0 . b . if the first value is 1 and the second value is 0 , then the output is 0 . c. if the first value is 0 and the second value is 0 , then the output is 1 . d. if the first value is 1 and the second value is 1 , then the output is 0 .","the correct answer is d. an xor operation requires two inputs , and in the case of encryption algorithms , this would be the data bits and the key bits . each bit is fed into the operation—one from the data , the next from the key—and then xor makes a determination : if the bits match , the output is 0 ; if they don ’ t , it ’ s 1 ."
D,D,which of the following attacks attempts to re-send a portion of a cryptographic exchange in hopes of setting up a communications channel ? a . known plain text b . chosen plain text c. man in the middle d. replay,"the correct answer is d. replay attacks are most often performed within the context of a man-in-themiddle attack and not necessarily just for communications channel setup . they ’ re also used for dos attacks against a system , to feed bad data in hopes of corrupting a system , to try to overflow a buffer ( send more encrypted data than expected ) , and so on . the hacker repeats a portion of a cryptographic exchange in hopes of fooling the system into setting up a communications channel . the attacker doesn ’ t really have to know the actual data ( such as the password ) being exchanged ; he just has to get the timing right in copying and then replaying the bit stream . session tokens can be used in the communications process to combat this attack ."
D,D,"within a pki system , which of the following is an accurate statement ? a . bill can be sure a message came from sue by using his public key to decrypt it . b . bill can be sure a message came from sue by using his private key to decrypt it . c. bill can be sure a message came from sue by using her private key to decrypt the digital signature . d. bill can be sure a message came from sue by using her public key to decrypt the digital signature","the correct answer is d. remember , a digital signature is a hash value that is encrypted with the user ’ s private key . because the corresponding public key can decrypt it , this provides the nonrepudiation feature we ’ re looking for . this is the only instance on the exam where the private key is used for encryption . in general , public encrypts , and private decrypts . the steps for creating an encrypted message with a digital signature are as follows : 1 . create a hash of the body of the message . 2 . encrypt that hash with your private key ( adding it to the message as your signature ) . 3 . encrypt the entire message with the public key of the recipient ."
D,D,a systems administrator is applying digital certificates for authentication and verification services inside his network . he creates public and private key pairs using apple ’ s keychain and uses the public key to sign documents that are used throughout the network . which of the following certificate types is in use ? a . public b . private c. signed d. self-signed,"the correct answer is d. security certificates have many uses in networking : for example , applications and network services might use them for authentication . if you are doing business across the internet , your clients will want to ensure a trusted third party signs your certificates , so they can verify you are indeed legitimate . internally , though , due to cost and speed of deployment/maintenance , self-signed certificates are the way to go . a self-signed certificate is simply one that is signed by the same entity that created it . because most of your internal certificate needs can be served without going to an external ca to verify identity , using self-signed certificates may be the best bet ."
D,D,"while observing a target organization ’ s building , you note the lone entrance has a guard posted just inside the door . after entering the external door , you note the lobby of the building is separated from the external door by a small glass-paneled room , with a closed door facing the exterior and a closed door to the interior . there appears to be an rfid scanning device and a small keyboard with video display in the room . which of the following best defines this physical security control ? a . guard shack b. turnstile c. man shack d. man trap","the correct answer is d. if you took a test on college football history , you know it would contain a question about alabama . if you took one on trumpet players , there ’ d be one about dizzy gillespie . and if you take a test on physical security measures for certified ethical hacker , you ’ re going to be asked about the man trap . a man trap is nothing more than a locked space you can hold someone in while verifying their right to proceed into the secured area . it ’ s usually a glass ( or clear plastic ) walled room that locks the exterior door as soon as the person enters . then there is some sort of authentication mechanism , such as a smartcard with a pin or a biometric system . assuming the authentication is successful , the second door leading to the interior of the building will unlock , and the person is allowed to proceed . if it ’ s not successful , the doors will remain locked until the guard can check things out . as an aside , in addition to authentication , some man traps add other checks , such as measuring the person ’ s weight to see if they ’ ve mysteriously gained or lost 20 pounds since friday . a few other notes here may be of use to you : first , i ’ ve seen a man trap defined as either manual or automatic , where manual has a guard locking and unlocking the doors and automatic has the locks tied to the authentication system , as described previously . second , a man trap is also referred to in some definitions as an air lock . should you see that term on the exam , know that it is referring to the man trap . third , man traps in the real world can sometimes come in the form of a rotating door or turnstile , locking partway around if the person doesn ’ t authenticate properly . and , on some of the really fancy ones , sensors will lock the man trap if two people are trying to get through at the same time . and , finally , one last note of importance—a man trap is also defined or known as an access control vestibule . just rolls right off the tongue , doesn ’ t it ?"
C,C,"in your social engineering efforts , you call the company help desk and pose as a user who has forgotten a password . you ask the technician to help you reset your password , which she happily complies with . which social engineering attack is in use here ? a. piggybacking b . reverse social engineering c. technical support d. halo effect","the correct answer is c. although it may seem silly to label social engineering attacks ( because many of them contain the same steps and bleed over into one another ) , you ’ ll need to memorize them for your exam . a technical support attack is one in which the attacker calls the support desk in an effort to gain a password reset or other useful information . this is a valuable method because if you get the right help desk person ( that is , someone susceptible to a smooth-talking social engineer ) , you can get the keys to the kingdom ."
A,A,"which of the following is a true statement regarding biometric systems ? a . the lower the cer , the better the biometric system . b . the higher the cer , the better the biometric system . c. the higher the frr , the better the biometric system . d. the higher the far , the better the biometric system .","the correct answer is a . the crossover error rate ( cer ) is the point on a chart where the false acceptance rate ( far ) and false rejection rate ( frr ) meet , and the lower the number , the better the system . it ’ s a means by which biometric systems are calibrated—getting the far and frr the same . all that said , though , keep in mind that in certain circumstances a client may be more interested in a lower far than frr , or vice versa , and therefore the cer isn ’ t as much a concern . for example , a bank may be far more interested in preventing false acceptance than it is in preventing false rejection . in other words , so what if a user is upset they can ’ t log on , so long as their money is safe from a false acceptance ?"
D,D,"a pen tester sends an unsolicited e-mail to several users in the target organization . the e-mail is well crafted and appears to be from the company ’ s help desk , advising users of potential network problems . the e-mail provides a contact number to call in the event a user is adversely affected . the pen tester then performs a denial of service on several systems and receives phone calls from users asking for assistance . which social engineering practice is in play here ? a . technical support b. impersonation c. phishing d. reverse social engineering","the correct answer is d. this may turn out to be a somewhat confusing question for some folks , but it ’ s actually pretty easy . reverse social engineering involves three steps . first , in the marketing phase , an attacker advertises himself as a technical point of contact for problems that may be occurring soon . second , in the sabotage phase , the attacker performs a denial of service or other attack on the user . third , in the tech support phase , the user calls the attacker and freely hands over information , thinking they are being assisted by the company ’ s technical support team . as an aside , there are two things to remember about employing this social engineering practice in the real world . first , be sure to market to the appropriate audience : attempting this against it staff probably won ’ t work as well as the “ average ” user and may get you caught . second , and perhaps more important , you ’ ll need to remember that the more lies you tell , the more things you have to make true . complexity is risky , and reverse social engineering involves a lot of complexity . it ’ s best used in special cases , and then only if you can ’ t find something else to do ."
C,C,"a pen test member has gained access to a building and is observing activity as he wanders around . in one room of the building , he stands just outside a cubicle wall opening and watches the onscreen activity of a user . which social engineering attack is in use here ? a. eavesdropping b. tailgating c. shoulder surfing d. piggybacking","the correct answer is c. this one is so easy i hope you maintain your composure and stifle the urge to whoop and yell in the test room . shoulder surfing doesn ’ t necessarily require you to actually be on the victim ’ s shoulder—you just have to be able to watch their onscreen activity . i once shoulder surfed in front of someone ( a mirror behind her showed her screen clear as day ) . you don ’ t even really need to be close to the victim—there are plenty of optics that can zoom in a field of vision from a very long distance away . as an aside , in the real world , if you are close enough to see someone ’ s screen , you ’ re probably close enough to listen to them as well . ec-council puts the emphasis of shoulder surfing on the visual aspect—eavesdropping would be auditory ."
A,A,"a recent incident investigated by the local ir team involved a user receiving an e-mail that appeared to be from the u.s . postal service , notifying her of a package headed her way and providing a link for tracking the package . the link provided took the user to what appeared to be the usps site , where she input her user information to learn about the latest shipment being delivered . which attack did the user fall victim to ? a. phishing b. internet level c. reverse social engineering d. impersonation","the correct answer is a. phishing is one of the most pervasive and effective social engineering attacks on the planet . it ’ s successful because crafting a legitimate-looking e-mail that links a user to an illegitimate site or malware package is easy to do . what ’ s more , the e-mail is easy to spread , and it preys on our human nature to trust . if the source of the e-mail looks legitimate or the layout looks legitimate , most people will click away without even thinking about it . phishing e-mails can often include pictures lifted directly off the legitimate website and use creative means of spelling that aren ’ t easy to spot : www .regions.com is a legitimate bank website that could be spelled in a phishing e-mail as www.regi0ns.com . when it comes to real-world use of phishing by ethical hackers and pen testers , there are a couple items of note : first , phishing has an extreme liability aspect to it when spoofing a legitimate business . if you ’ re pen testing an organization and phish using a variant of a real business name , you could be opening yourself up to some serious costs : the first time someone calls the real regions bank to complain is the moment that the attacker just became liable for the costs associated with the attack . second is the risk involved with people simply forwarding your phishing attempt to recipients you never intended , allowing it to take on a life of its own . in short , the pen tester will certainly limit the bait ( malware or website link embedded in the phishing attempt ) , but they will have no control over what a user decides to do with the e-mail . suppose the pen tester doesn ’ t know the exact ip range or makes a simple mistake in the configuration of the malware , and a user sends it home . or to a banking friend . or to the fbi . or to a friend who works on a dod system . now you ’ ve not only hooked the wrong fish but maybe infected something in the government . that ’ s nothing to joke about , and it may be a lot worse than a simple mistake . the bottom line is , in the real world , phishing is dangerous if not planned and implemented almost perfectly , and pen test teams need to use extreme caution in implementing it ."
B,B,"which type of social engineering attack uses phishing , pop-ups , and irc channels ? a . technical b . computer based c. human based d. physical","the correct answer is b . all social engineering attacks fall into one of two categories : human based or computer based . computer-based attacks are those carried out with the use of a computer or other data-processing device . some examples are fake pop-up windows , sms texts , e-mails , and chat rooms or services . social media sites ( such as facebook and linkedin ) are consistent examples as well , and spoofing entire websites isn ’ t out of the realm of possibility here either ."

D,D,which of the following constitutes the highest risk to the organization ? a. black-hat hacker b. white-hat hacker c. gray-hat hacker d. disgruntled employee,"the correct answer is d. when we consider security measures , most of our attention is usually aimed outside the company , because that ’ s where all the bad guys are , right ? unfortunately , this line of thinking leads to all sorts of exposure , for many reasons , and it ’ s more common than you might think . a disgruntled employee is still an employee , after all , which leads to the main reason they ’ re so dangerous : location . they are already inside the network . inside attacks are generally easier to launch , are more successful , and are harder to prevent . when you add the human element of having an axe to grind , this can boil over quickly—whether or not the employee has the technical knowledge to pull off the attack . the idea that someone wanting to do harm to our organization ’ s network not only already has the access to do so but has it because we gave it to them and we ’ re not watching them should be frightening to us all ."

"A,B,D","A,B,D",which of the following may be effective countermeasures against social engineering ? ( choose all that apply . ) a . security policies b . operational guidelines c. appropriately configured ids d. user education and training e. strong firewall configuration,"the correct answer is a , b , d. ecc identifies several countermeasures against social engineering , but in the real world , none of them ( by themselves or grouped ) is really the key . the problem with most countermeasures against social engineering is they ’ re almost totally out of your control . sure , you can draft strong policy requiring users to comply with security measures , implement guidelines on everything imaginable to reduce risks and streamline efficiency , and hold educational briefings and training sessions for each and every user in your organization , but when it comes down to it , it ’ s the user who has to do the right thing . all countermeasures for social engineering have something to do with the users themselves because they are the weak link here ."
"A,B,C,D","A,B,C,D",which of the following are indicators of a phishing e-mail ? ( choose all that apply . ) a . it does not reference you by name . b . it contains misspelled words or grammatical errors . c. it contains spoofed links . d. it comes from an unverified source .,"the correct answer is a , b , c , d. one of the objectives ec-council has kept around in its many ceh versions is , and i quote , to “ understand phishing attacks. ” part of the official curriculum to study for the exam covers detecting phishing e-mail in depth , and all of these answers are indicators an e-mail might not be legitimate . first , most companies now sending e-mail to customers will reference you by name and sometimes by account number . an e-mail starting with “ dear customer ” or something to that effect may be an indicator something is amiss . misspellings and grammatical errors from a business are also usually dead giveaways because companies do their best to proofread items before they are released . there are , occasionally , some slipups ( internet search some of these ; they ’ re truly funny ) , but those are definitely the exception and not the rule . spoofed links can be found by hovering a mouse over them ( or by looking at their properties ) . the link text may read www.yourbank.com , but the hyperlink properties will be sending you to some ip address you don ’ t want to go to . and finally , any e-mail coming from an “ unverified source ” can and should be viewed with caution . what makes something an unverified source ? that depends on the eye of the beholder . in many cases , it ’ s simply an address ( or person ) you don ’ t know or haven ’ t seen before . in others it ’ s a very close representation of an e-mail address you ’ d recognize , but turns out to be malicious . in any of these cases , your best bet for personal and organizational security is this : don ’ t click it . it shouldn ’ t matter to you who the e-mail is from , whether it ’ s grammatically perfect , and the links look legitimate—just put yourself in the habit of not clicking links in e-mail at all . trust me , you and your organization will be safer . as an aside , while these are all great answers to a question on an exam , don ’ t let them dictate your day-to-day internet life outside of your exam . a perfectly written , grammatically correct e-mail containing real links and originating from someone you trust could still be part of a phishing campaign . never click a link in an e-mail without knowing exactly what it is and where it ’ s taking you—no matter who you think the message is from or how well written it is . finally , if you get a phishing e-mail that is accurate , references you by name , has real links , and truly appears to be accurate , you probably have a real problem on your hands . everyone gets the annoying “ spam ” e-mails with “ click here for free stuff. ” however , if you get one that is delivered to you , with your name and identifying details in it , you have someone who spent the time to target you specifically , not randomly ."
C,C,you are discussing physical security measures and are covering background checks on employees and policies regarding key management and storage . which type of physical security measures are being discussed ? a . physical b . technical c. operational d. practical,"the correct answer is c. physical security has three major facets : physical measures , technical measures , and operational measures . operational measures ( sometimes referred to as procedural controls ) are the policies and procedures you put into place to assist with security . background checks on employees and any kind of written policy for operational behaviors are prime examples ."
"B,C","B,C",which of the following resources can assist in combating phishing in your organization ? ( choose all that apply . ) a. phishkill b. netcraft c. phishtank d. ida pro,"the correct answer is b , c. for obvious reasons , there are not a lot of questions from these objectives concerning tools—mainly because social engineering is all about the human side of things , not necessarily using technology or tools . however , you can put into place more than a few protective applications to help stem the tide . there are innumerable e-mail-filtering applications and appliances you can put on an e-mail network boundary to cut down on the vast amount of traffic ( spam or otherwise ) headed to your network . additionally , netcraft ’ s phishing toolbar and phishtank are two client-side , host-based options you can use ( there are others , but these are pointed out specifically in ec-council ’ s official courseware ) . netcraft ’ s ( url and phishtank ’ s ( www.phishtank.com/ ) toolbars are like neighborhood watches on virtual steroids , where eagle-eyed neighbors can see suspicious traffic and alert everyone else . the following is from the netcraft site : “ once the first recipients of a phishing mail have reported the target url , it is blocked for community members as they subsequently access the url. ” these tools , although useful , are not designed to completely protect against phishing . much like antivirus software , they will act on attempts that match a signature file . this , sometimes , makes it even easier on the attacker—because they know which phishing will not work right off the bat ."
D,D,"an attacker targets a specific group inside the organization . after some time profiling the group , she notes several websites the individual members of the group all visit on a regular basis . she spends time inserting various malware and malicious code into some of the more susceptible websites . within a matter of days , one of the group member ’ s system installs the malware from an infected site , and the attacker uses the infected machine as a pivot point inside the network . which of the following best defines this attack ? a . spear phishing b. whaling c. web-ishing d. watering hole attack","the correct answer is d. have you ever watched nature documentaries on the discovery channel ? it seems predators frequently hang out in places where the prey tends to show up . for example , a pride of lions might just hang out near a watering hole—knowing full well their prey will eventually just come to them . this attack uses the same principle , except we ’ re talking about the virtual world . and none of us are lions ( at least not outside our imaginations , anyway ) . in a watering hole attack , the bad guy spends a lot of time profiling the group that is being targeted ( note the key wording in this is that a group is targeted , not an individual ) . the attacker can observe or even guess websites the group would visit , and then infect those sites with some sort of malware or malicious code . eventually , someone from the group will visit the virtual watering hole and—voilà—success ."
C,C,"which type of social engineering makes use of impersonation , dumpster diving , shoulder surfing , and tailgating ? a . physical b . technical c. human based d. computer based","the correct answer is c. once again , we ’ re back to the two major forms of social engineering : human based and computer based . human-based attacks include all the attacks mentioned here and a few more . human-based social engineering uses interaction in conversation or other circumstances between people to gather useful information . this can be as blatant as simply asking someone for their password or pretending to be a known entity ( authorized user , tech support , or company executive ) in order to gain information ."
B,B,"in examining the about us link in the menu of a target organization ’ s website , an attacker discovers several different individual contacts within the company . to one of these contacts , she crafts an e-mail asking for information that appears to come from an individual within the company who would be expected to make such a request . the e-mail provides a link to click , which then prompts for the contact ’ s user id and password . which of the following best describes this attack ? a. trojan e-mailing b . spear phishing c. social networking d. operational engineering","the correct answer is b . yes , sometimes you ’ ll get an easy one . phishing is using e-mail to accomplish the social engineering task . spear phishing is actually targeting those e-mails to specific individuals or groups within an organization . this usually has a much higher success rate than just a blind-fire phishing effort ."
B,B,a security admin has a control in place that embeds a unique image into e-mails on specific topics in order to verify the message as authentic and trusted . which antiphishing method is being used ? a. steganography b. sign-in seal c. pki d. captcha,"the correct answer is b. sign-in seal is an e-mail protection method in use at a variety of business locations . the practice is to use a secret message or image that can be referenced on any official communication with the site . if you receive an e-mail purportedly from the business but it does not include the image or message , you ’ re aware it ’ s probably a phishing attempt . this sign-in seal is kept locally on your computer , so the theory is that no one can copy or spoof it ."
"A,B,C,D","A,B,C,D",which of the following should be in place to assist as a social engineering countermeasure ? ( choose all that apply . ) a . classification of information b . strong security policy c. user education d. strong change management process,"the correct answer is a , b , c , d. all of the answers are correct , but let ’ s get this out of the way up front : you ’ ll never be able to put anything whatsoever into place that will effectively render all social engineering attacks moot . you can do some things to limit them , and those on this list can definitely help in that regard , but an organization that responds to social engineering concerns with “ we have a strong security policy and great user education ” is probably one that ’ ll see a high turnover rate . classification of information is seen as a strong countermeasure because the information—and access to it—is stored and processed according to strict definitions of sensitivity . in the government/dod world , you ’ d see labels such as confidential , secret , and top secret . in the commercial world , you might see public , sensitive , and confidential . i could write an entire chapter on the difference between dod and commercial labels and argue the finer points of various access control methods , but we ’ ll stick just to this chapter and what you need here . as a side note , classification of information won ’ t do you a bit of good if the enforcement of access to that information , and the protection of it in storage or transit , is lax . strong security policy has been covered earlier in the chapter , so i won ’ t waste much print space here on it . you must have a good one in place to help prevent a variety of security failures ; however , you can ’ t rely on it as a countermeasure on its own . according to ec-council , user education is not only a viable social engineering countermeasure but it ’ s the best measure you can take . anyone reading this book who has spent any time at all trying to educate users on a production , enterpriselevel network is probably yelling right now because results can sometimes be spotty at best . however , the weak point in the chain is the user , so we must do our best to educate users on what to look for and what to do when they see it . there simply is no better defense than a well-educated user ( and by “ well-educated ” i mean a user who absolutely refuses to participate in a social engineering attempt ) . there ’ s just not that many of them out there . a change management process helps to organize alterations to a system or organization by providing a standardized , reviewable process to any major change . in other words , if you allow changes to your financial system , it services , or hr processes without any review or control process , you ’ re basically opening pandora ’ s box . change can be made on a whim ( sometimes at the behest of a social engineer , maybe ? ) , and there ’ s no control or tracking of it ."
D,D,joe uses a user id and password to log in to the system every day . jill uses a piv card and a pin . which of the following statements is true ? a. joe and jill are using single-factor authentication . b. joe and jill are using two-factor authentication . c. joe is using two-factor authentication . d. jill is using two-factor authentication .,"the correct answer is d. when it comes to authentication systems , you can use three factors to prove your identity : something you know , something you have , and something you are . an item you know is , basically , a password or pin . something you have is a physical token of some sort—usually a smartcard—that is presented as part of the authentication process . something you are relates to biometrics—a fingerprint or retinal scan , for instance . generally speaking , the more factors you have in place , the better ( more secure ) the authentication system . in this example , joe is using only something he knows , whereas jill is using something she has ( piv card ) and something she knows ( pin ) ."
A,A,a system owner has implemented a retinal scanner at the entryway to the data floor . which type of physical security measure is this ? a . technical b . single factor c. computer based d. operational,"the correct answer is a . physical security measures are characterized as physical ( door locks and guards ) , operational ( policies and procedures ) , and technical ( authentications systems and permissions ) . this example falls into the technical security measure category . sure , the door itself is physical , but the question centers on the biometric system , which is clearly technical in origin ."
B,B,which of the following is the best representation of a technical control ? a . air conditioning b . security tokens c. automated humidity control d. fire alarms e. security policy,"the correct answer is b . all security controls are put into place to minimize , or to avoid altogether , the probability of a successful exploitation of a risk or vulnerability . logical controls ( logical is the other term used for technical ) do this through technical , systemdriven means . examples include security tokens , authentication mechanisms , and antivirus software ."

C,C,incident response ( ir ) is an important part of organizational security . in what step of the incident-handling process would ir team members disable or delete user accounts and change firewall rules ? a . detection and analysis b . classification and prioritization c. containment d. forensic investigation,"the correct answer is c. in a refrain you ’ ve heard over and over again throughout this book , sometimes real life and ec-council don ’ t see eye to eye . however , when it comes to ir , ecc kind of gets it right . almost . lots of organizations define the incident-handling response in different ways , with different phases for actions taken . generally speaking , though , all incident handling falls into four sets of actions : identify , contain , eradicate , and recover . most organizations will define a preparation phase beforehand and a lessons learned phase at the end for a full incident process . ecc defines eight phases : • preparation defining rules , processes , and toolsets and then testing them ( usually with some regularly scheduled exercises , at a minimum ) occur in this phase . • detection and analysis this is where alerting functions ( toolsets , ids , ips , users notifying of strange events , and so on ) and initial research into the event take place . • classification and prioritization decision making on whether to elevate as an incident and at what level to elevate is made here ( ramping up an ir event for a false alarm serves no one ) . levels of categorization vary from organization to organization , but usually assign response time frames to levels . • notification alerting appropriate teams and organizations to assist in the event occurs here . • containment steps to contain the incident occur here . these may include steps to revoke or suspend user accounts and blocking system or even subnet access via a firewall or other method . • forensic investigation in this stage , if possible , live memory and disk captures are pulled for evaluation and analysis . this does not have to wait until the conclusion of the event , but , depending on the assets involved and the nature of the incident , forensics may have to wait . • eradication and recovery this phase encompasses all the steps taken to remove the incident cause ( malware , malicious code , backdoors , rootkits , viruses , and so on ) and to return the assets involved to baseline standards before putting them back into production . • post-incident this is where reporting , follow-up analysis , and lessons learned are put together . evaluation from this step is fed into the preparation phase for the next event . questions on incident response and incident handling can be pretty vague . for the most part , common sense should guide you on anything truly weird , but most questions will be like this one—fairly easy to figure out on your own . one last note here : the four phases listed at the beginning of this answer description will more than likely be what you ’ ll see on the exam , so when in doubt , i would stick with them ."
B,B,"a software company puts an application through stringent testing and , on the date of release , is confident the software is free of known vulnerabilities . an organization named bigbiz purchases the software at a premium cost , with a guarantee of service , maintenance , and liability . which risk management method is in use by the bigbiz organization ? a . accept b . transfer c. avoid d. mitigate","the correct answer is b . depending on who you talk to , there are as many as seven different methods in risk management . of primary concern for you and ec-council , however , are these four : accept , avoid , transfer , and mitigate . in this example , the organization has paid a cost to the software developer , trusting them that they ’ ve tested the software and that they will assume responsibility and liability for it . in effect , the organization has transferred the risk to the software company for this application . transferring risk is all about finding a different entity to take responsibility for managing the risk , as well as accepting the liability of an exploitation or loss resulting from the risk ."
"A,C,D","A,C,D",which of the following provide automated pen-test-like results for an organization ? ( choose all that apply . ) a. metasploit b. nessus c. core impact d. canvas e. saint f. gfi languard,"the correct answer is a , c , d. automated tool suites for pen testing can be viewed as a means to save time and money by the client ’ s management , but ( in my opinion and in the real world , at least ) these tools don ’ t do either . they do not provide the same quality results as a test performed by security professionals , and they are extremely expensive . automated tools can provide a lot of genuinely good information , but they are also susceptible to false positives and false negatives and don ’ t necessarily care what your agreed-upon scope says is your stopping point . metasploit has a free , open source version and an insanely expensive “ pro ” version for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine—still worlds cheaper than core impact , but expensive nonetheless . metasploit offers an autopwn module that can automate the exploitation phase of a penetration test . core impact is probably the best-known , all-inclusive automated testing framework . per its website ( url core impact “ takes security testing to the next level by safely replicating a broad range of threats to the organization ’ s sensitive data and mission-critical infrastructure—providing extensive visibility into the cause , effect , and prevention of data breaches. ” core impact tests everything from web applications and individual systems to network devices and wireless . per the immunity security website ( www.immunitysec.com ) , canvas “ makes available hundreds of exploits , an automated exploitation system , and a comprehensive , reliable exploit development framework to penetration testers and security professionals. ” additionally , the company claims canvas ’ s reference implementation ( cri ) is “ the industry ’ s first open platform for ids and ips testing. ” for you real-world purists out there and for those who don ’ t have any experience with any of this just quite yet , it ’ s important to note that no automated testing suite provides anything close to the results you ’ d gain from a real pen test . core impact provides a one-step automated pen test result feature ( and probably offers the best result and report features ) , metasploit offers autopwn , and canvas has a similar “ run everything ” mode ; however , all lack the ability to provide results that a true pen test would provide . in the truest sense of “ automated pen testing , ” you simply can ’ t do it in the real world ( for your exam , stick with the three listed here ) ."
C,C,which of the following best describes an assessment against a network segment that tests for existing vulnerabilities but does not attempt to exploit any of them ? a . penetration test b . partial penetration test c. vulnerability assessment d. security audit,"the correct answer is c. a vulnerability assessment is exactly what it sounds like : the search for and identification of potentially exploitable vulnerabilities on a system or network . these vulnerabilities can be poor security configurations , missing patches , or any number of other weaknesses a bad guy might exploit . the two keys to a vulnerability assessment are that the vulnerabilities are identified , not exploited , and the report is simply a snapshot in time . the organization will need to determine how often it wants to run a vulnerability assessment . lastly , it ’ s important to note that there are some vulnerabilities that simply can ’ t be confirmed without exploiting them . for example , the act of infecting sql statements to expose an sql injection vulnerability may very well constitute an exploit action , but it ’ s the only way to prove it exists . for your exam , though , stick with no exploitation during this assessment and move on with your life ."
C,C,"you are a member of a pen test team conducting tests . your team has all necessary scope , terms of engagement , and nondisclosure and service level agreements in place . you gain access to an employee ’ s system , and during further testing discover child pornography on a hidden drive folder . which of the following is your best course of action as an ethical hacker ? a . continue testing without notification to anyone , but ensure the information is included in the final out-brief report . b . continue testing without interruption , but completely remove all hidden files and the folder containing the pornography . c. stop testing and notify law enforcement authorities immediately . d. stop testing and remove all evidence of intrusion into the machine .","the correct answer is c. if you ’ ve ever taken any philosophy classes in high school or college , you ’ ve undoubtedly read some of the ethical dilemmas presented to challenge black-and-white thinking on a matter . for example , theft is undoubtedly bad and is recognized as a crime in virtually every law system on the planet , but what if it ’ s the only way to save a child ’ s life ? in ethical hacking , there are fine lines on actions to take when you discover something , and sometimes hard edges where there is no choice in the matter . possession of child porn is a crime , so this case would seem relatively easy to discern . to be fair , and to make the assumption you ’ ll need to on questions like this on the exam , your course of action is straightforward and simple : notify the authorities and let them handle it . in the real world , things might be a little more difficult . how do you really know what you ’ re looking at ? are you positive that what you see is illegal in nature ( regardless of what it is—pornography , documentation , letters , and so on ) ? if you ’ re not and you falsely accuse someone , what kind of liability do you face ? what about your team ? it ’ s not an easy question to answer when you ’ re in the heat of battle , and you ’ ll have to largely depend on good , solid pen test agreements up front . let the client know what actions will be taken when suspected illegal material is discovered , and agree upon actions both sides will take . otherwise you , and your client , could be in for very difficult times ."
A,A,in which phase of a pen test is scanning performed ? a. pre-attack b . attack c. post-attack d. reconnaissance,"the correct answer is a. i know you ’ re sick of ceh definitions , terms , and phases of attacks , but this is another one you ’ ll just need to commit to memory . per ec-council , there are three phases of a pen test : pre-attack , attack , and post-attack . the pre-attack phase is where you ’ d find scanning and other reconnaissance activities ( gathering competitive intelligence , website crawling , and so on ) ."
A,A,which of the following describes risk that remains after all security controls have been implemented to the best of one ’ s ability ? a . residual b . inherent c. deferred d. remaining,"the correct answer is a . risk management has a lot of terminology to remember , and identifying risk before and after security control implementation is what this question is all about . the inherent risk of the system is that which is in place if you implement no security controls whatsoever : in other words , there are risks inherent to every system , application , technology , and service . after you recognize these inherent risks and implement security controls , you may have some residual risks remaining . in other words , residual risk is what is left in the system after you implement security controls ."

B,B,in which phase of a pen test will the team penetrate the perimeter and acquire targets ? a. pre-attack b . attack c. post-attack d. none of the above,"the correct answer is b. ec-council splits a pen test into three phases : pre-attack , attack , and post-attack . in the attack phase , the team will attempt to penetrate the network perimeter , acquire targets , execute attacks , and elevate privileges . getting past the perimeter might take into account things such as verifying acls by crafting packets as well as checking the use of any covert tunnels inside the organization . attacks such as xss , buffer overflows , and sql injections will be used on web-facing applications and sites . after specific targets are acquired , password cracking , privilege escalation , and a host of other attacks will be carried out ."
A,A,"an organization participates in a real-world exercise designed to test all facets of its security systems . an independent group is hired to assist the organization ’ s security groups , aiding in the defense of assets against the attacks from the attacking group . which of the following statements is true ? a . the group assisting in the defense of the systems is referred to as a blue team . b . the group assisting in the defense of the systems is referred to as a red team . c. the group assisting in the defense of the systems is known as a white-hat group . d. the team attacking the systems must provide all details of any planned attack with the defense group before launching to ensure security measures are tested appropriately","the correct answer is a . many organizations run full “ war game ” scenarios , which include defense and attack groups , to test security measures . generally speaking , the group doing the attacking is known as a red team , while the group assisting with the defense is known as a blue team . the red team is the offense-minded group , simulating the bad guys in the world , actively attacking and exploiting everything they can find in the environment . in a traditional war game scenario , the red team is attacking “ black-box ” style , given little to no information to start things off . a blue team , on the other hand , is defensive in nature . the members of the blue team are not out attacking things ; rather , they ’ re focused on shoring up defenses and making things safe . unlike red teams , blue teams are responsible for defense against the bad guys , so they usually operate with full knowledge of the internal environment.blue teams are almost always independent in terms of the target , but their goal is to assist the defenders and to do so with whatever information is available . the difference between blue and red in this scenario is in the cooperative versus adversarial nature : red is there to be the bad guys , do what they would do , look for the impacts they would want to have , and to test the organization ’ s defense/response , whereas blue is there to help ."
D,D,which of the following best describes the difference between a professional pen test team member and a hacker ? a . ethical hackers are paid for their time . b . ethical hackers never exploit vulnerabilities ; they only point out their existence . c. ethical hackers do not use the same tools and actions as hackers . d. ethical hackers hold a predefined scope and agreement from the system owner,"the correct answer is d. this one is a blast from the book ’ s past and will pop up a couple of times on your exam . the only true difference between a professional pen test team member ( an ethical hacker ) and the hackers of the world is the existence of the formally approved , agreed-upon scope and contract before any attacks begin ."

C,C,in which phase of a penetration test would you compile a list of vulnerabilities found ? a. pre-attack b . attack c. post-attack d. reconciliation,the correct answer is c. this is another simple definition question you ’ re sure to see covered on the exam . you compile the results of all testing in the post-attack phase of a pen test so you can create and deliver the final report to the customer .
A,A,which of the following has a database containing thousands of signatures used to detect vulnerabilities in multiple operating systems ? a. nessus b. hping c. loic d. snmputil,"the correct answer is a. nessus is probably the best-known , most utilized vulnerability assessment tool on the planet—even though it ’ s not necessarily free anymore . nessus works on a client/ server basis and provides “ plug-ins ” to test everything from cisco devices , macos , and windows machines to scada devices , snmp , and vmware esx ( you can find a list of plug-in families at www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php ? view=all ) . it ’ s part of virtually every security team ’ s portfolio , and you should definitely spend some time learning how to use it . as an aside—not necessarily because it has anything to do with your test but because i am all about informing you on how to become a good pen tester—openvas ( www.openvas.org ) is the open source community ’ s attempt at a free vulnerability scanner . nessus was a free scanner for the longest time . however , once nessus was purchased by tenable network security , it , for lack of a better term , angered a lot of people in the security community because nessus became a for-profit entity instead of a for-security one . don ’ t get me wrong—nessus is outstanding in what it does ; it just costs you money . openvas is attempting to do the same thing for free because the community wants security over profit . just keep in mind that most vulnerabilities that are actually capable of causing harm to your systems probably won ’ t be found by any scanner . the recent heartbleed vulnerability , which takes advantage of an ssl issue , is a prime example : scanners simply can ’ t find vulnerabilities we don ’ t already know about ."
D,D,cleaning registry entries and removing uploaded files and tools are part of which phase of a pen test ? a . covering tracks b. pre-attack c. attack d. post-attack,"the correct answer is d. cleaning up all your efforts occurs in the post-attack phase , alongside analyzing the findings and generating the final report . the goal is to put things back exactly how they were before the assessment ."

B,B,which of the following causes a potential security breach ? a . vulnerability b . threat c. exploit d. zero day,"the correct answer is b . so which came first—the chicken or the egg ? this question is right along those same lines and can be really confusing , but if you key on the “ cause ” portion of the question , you should be okay . sure , a vulnerability would need to be present ; however , a vulnerability on its own doesn ’ t cause anything . a threat is something that could potentially take advantage of an existing vulnerability . threats can be intentional , accidental , human , or even an “ act of god. ” a hacker is a threat to take advantage of an open port on a system and/or poor password policy . a thunderstorm is a threat to exploit a tear in the roof , leaking down into your systems . heck , a rhinoceros is a threat to bust down the door and destroy all the equipment in the room . whether those threats have intent , are viable , and are willing/able to take up the vulnerability is a matter for risk assessment to decide ; they ’ ll probably beef up password policy and fix the roof , but i doubt much will be done on the rhino front ."
B,B,which metasploit payload type operates via dll injection and is difficult for antivirus software to pick up ? a. inline b. meterpreter c. staged d. remote,"the correct answer is b . for those of you panicking over this question , relax . you do not have to know all the inner workings of metasploit , but it does appear enough—in the variety of study materials available for ceh certification—that ec-council wants you to know some basics , and this question falls in that category . there are a bunch of different payload types within metasploit , and meterpreter ( short for meta-interpreter ) is one of them . the following is from metasploit ’ s website : “ meterpreter is an advanced payload that is included in the metasploit framework . its purpose is to provide complex and advanced features that would otherwise be tedious to implement purely in assembly . the way that it accomplishes this is by allowing developers to write their own extensions in the form of shared object ( dll ) files that can be uploaded and injected into a running process on a target computer after exploitation has occurred . meterpreter and all of the extensions that it loads are executed entirely from memory and never touch the disk , thus allowing them to execute under the radar of standard anti-virus detection . ”"
D,D,"metasploit is a framework allowing for the development and execution of exploit code against a remote host and is designed for use in pen testing . the framework consists of several libraries , each performing a specific task and set of functions . which library is considered the most fundamental component of the metasploit framework ? a. msf core b. msf base c. msf interfaces d. rex","the correct answer is d. once again , this is another one of those weird questions you may see ( involving any of the framework components ) on your exam . it ’ s included here so you ’ re not caught off guard in the actual exam room and freak out over not hearing it before . don ’ t worry about learning all the nuances of metasploit and its architecture before the exam—just concentrate on memorizing the basics of the framework ( key words for each area will assist with this ) , and you ’ ll be fine . metasploit , as you know , is an open source framework allowing a variety of automated ( point-and-shoot ) pen test methods . the framework is designed in a modular fashion , with each library and component responsible for its own function . the following is from metasploit ’ s development guide ( you can find copies in a variety of places now ; just use a google search for msf_dev_guide filetype : pdf ) : “ the most fundamental piece of the architecture is the rex library , which is short for the ruby extension library . some of the components provided by rex include a wrapper socket subsystem , implementations of protocol clients and servers , a logging subsystem , exploitation utility classes , and a number of other useful classes. ” rex provides critical services to the entire framework ."
"A,B,C,D","A,B,C,D",which of the following may be effective countermeasures against an inside attacker ? ( choose all that apply . ) a . enforce elevated privilege control . b . secure all dumpsters and shred collection boxes . c. enforce good physical security practice and policy . d. perform background checks on all employees .,"the correct answer is a , b , c , d. all of the answers are correct . admittedly , there ’ s nothing you can really do to completely prevent an inside attack . there ’ s simply no way to ensure every single employee is going to remain happy and satisfied , just as there ’ s no way to tell when somebody might just up and decide to turn to crime . it happens all the time , in and out of corporate america , so the best you can do is , of course , the best you can do . enforcing elevated privilege control ( that is , ensuring users have only the amount of access , rights , and privileges to get their job done , and no more ) seems like a commonsense thing , but it ’ s amazing how many enterprise networks simply ignore this . after all , a disgruntled employee with administrator rights on his machine can certainly do more damage than one with just plain user rights . securing dumpsters and practicing good physical security should help protect against an insider who wants to come back after hours and snoop around . and performing background checks on employees , although by no means a silver bullet in this situation , can certainly help to ensure you ’ re hiring the right people in the first place ( in many companies a background check is a requirement of law ) . here are some of the other steps : • monitor user network behavior . • monitor user computer behavior . • disable remote access . • disable removable drive use on all systems ( usb drives and so on ) . • shred all discarded paperwork . • conduct user education and training programs ."

B,B,which of the following opens the computer management mmc in a windows command line ? a. compmgm.mmc b. compmgm.msc c. compmgm.exe d. compumgm.exe,"the correct answer is b . admittedly this one is an easy pick—assuming , of course , you ’ ve studied and know your mmcs in windows . you have studied them , right ? because if you had , you ’ d know that the microsoft management consoles can be used for a variety of tasks . some of these mmcs include computer management , device manager , event viewer , group policy editor , and active directory users and computers . while you can create your own custom mmc by typing mmc in the command line and then using add/remove snap-in from the menu line , you can also just open the individual consoles themselves by using their “ msc ” command-line option . for example , computer management can be a snap-in for a custom mmc , or you can open it by itself using the compmgmt.msc command . others you may want to know for future reference include ad users and computers ( dsa.msc ) , device manager ( devmgmt.msc ) , event viewer ( eventvwr.msc ) , local group policy editor ( gpedit.msc ) , and local security settings manager ( secpol.msc ) ."
A,A,which of the following will extract an executable file from ntfs streaming ? a. c : > cat file1.exe : hidden.exe > visible.exe b. c : > more file1.exe | hidden.exe > visible.exe c. c : > type notepad.exe > file1.exe : hidden.exe d. c : > list file1.exe $ hidden.exe > visible.exe,"the correct answer is a . this is the correct syntax . the cat command will extract the executable directly into the folder you execute the command from . ntfs file streaming allows you to hide virtually any file behind any other file , making it invisible to directory searches . the file can be a text file , to remind you of steps to take when you run the target , or even an executable file you can run at your leisure later . alternate data streams ( ads ) in the form of ntfs file streaming is a feature of the windows-native ntfs to ensure compatibility with apple file systems ( called hfs ) . be careful on the exam—you will see ads and ntfs file streaming used interchangeably . as an aside , the cat command isn ’ t available on windows 7 and windows 10 machines ( you ’ ll need a linux emulator or something like it to use the cat command on these ) . what ’ s more , you can use c : \ > ( more < file1.txt : hidden.exe ) > output.txt as another option . this will read the output of the hidden stream and write it to the output.txt file without having to use cat ."

D,D,in which step of ec-council ’ s system hacking methodology would you find steganography ? a. cracking passwords b . escalating privileges c. executing applications d. hiding files e. covering tracks,"the correct answer is d. yes , sometimes you get a question that ’ s relatively easy , and this is a prime example . hiding files is exactly what it sounds like : finding a way to hide files on the system . there are innumerable ways to accomplish this , but steganography is one method you ’ ll most likely see faced on the exam . steganography hides things such as passwords , files , or malicious code ( let ’ s just say anything that can be put into a binary format ) inside images , video , and such . the other file-hiding technique you ’ ll most likely see faced on the exam is ntfs file streaming ."
D,D,a view of the command history on a linux box shows the following command used : env x= ' ( ) { : ; } ; echo exploit ' bash –c 'cat /etc/passwd ' which of the following is the best description of what the attacker is attempting to accomplish ? a . add a user to the system . b. elevate current login privileges . c. change passwords for users . d. display password file contents .,"the correct answer is d. ever heard of bashdoor ( aka the shellshock vulnerability ) ? of course you have , and that ’ s what ’ s being compared here . vulnerable versions of the bash shell ( commonly used to process requests ) allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands concatenated on the end of function definitions stored in environment variables . in this case , the attacker is trying to read the contents of the password file using the cat command ."
D,D,you are examining lm password hashes and see the following : 3a02df5289cf6eefaad3b435b51404ee which of the following passwords is most likely to have created this hash ? a . 123456789 b. cehishard c. c3hish @ rd ! d. cehhad,"the correct answer is d. you will certainly see lm hashes on your exam at least once or twice , and usually in this type of scenario . ec-council isn ’ t just going to come out and ask you if you know that the last half of the lm hash is always the same if the password is seven characters or less—they ’ re going to show it in a scenario and see if you remember it in the stress of the exam . for review purposes , lm splits any password into two seven-character pieces and hashes each piece . if the password is seven characters or less , the last half of the hash is always the value of a hash of nothing ( which equates to aad3b435b51404ee , by the way ) . in this question , apply the lm “ splitting ” of passwords into two separate groups of seven characters , and it ’ s easy to see the answer : the first seven characters are cehhad and the second seven do not exist , so the hash of cehhad equals 3a02df5289cf6eef , and the hash of the blank characters equals aad3b435b51404ee . on a final note , because it ’ s late here , don ’ t get hung up on password complexity unless it is explicitly noted in the question . most people are in a rush during the exam and may not read things carefully . glancing at the answers , these folks might pick the complex password by mistake . therefore , use caution in reading the questions—make sure to fully understand what they ’ re asking for before just clicking the choice and moving on ."

A,A,which active online attack combines the use of a dictionary file with rules of a second or generated wordlist for password cracking ? a . combination b. fingerprint c. toggle-case d. markov-chain,"the correct answer is a . as i ’ ve mentioned innumerable times in this book and in the companion book ceh all-in-one exam guide , fifth edition , sometimes there are just terms and terminology you simply have to commit to memory . this is a prime example . of the choices provided , the combination attack makes the most sense here . in a combination attack , the first words from one dictionary file are combined with those from a second to create a broad-word list , which is then used to help crack the passwords ."
C,C,which authentication method uses des for encryption and forces 14-character passwords for hash storage ? a. ntlmv1 b. ntlmv2 c. lan manager d. kerberos,"the correct answer is c. lan manager is an old authentication model that burst onto the scene around the windows 95 launch . it uses des as a cipher standard ( a 56-bit key des , to be technical ) and , as covered before , has a quirky habit of capitalizing passwords and splitting them into two seven-character halves . believe it or not , this is still in use in the field . it ’ s mostly found in places where backward compatibility was needed for something and , eventually , it was just forgotten or overlooked ."
