C,C,"A is incorrect because, as I just mentioned, it’s impossible to reduce risk to absolute zero and still have a functional system. CEH Certified Ethical Hacker All-in-One Exam Guide, Fifth Edition, discusses the Security, Functionality, and Usability triangle, where as you move toward more security, you move further away from functionality and usability.","B is incorrect because it’s just silly. If you’re a security professional and your response to a risk—any risk—is to ignore it, I can promise you won’t be employed for long. Sure, you can point out that it’s low or residual and that the chance for actual exploitation is next to nonexistent, but you can’t ignore it. Best effort is for kindergarten trophies and IP packet delivery.","D is incorrect because removing all controls is worse than ignoring the risk. If you remove everything, then all risks remain. Remember, the objective is to balance your security controls to cover as much risk as possible while leaving the system as usable and functional as possible.","A security team is implementing various security controls across the organization. After considering several configurations and applications, a final agreed-on set of security controls is put into place; however, not all risks are mitigated by the controls. Of the following, which is the next best step?
A. Continue applying controls until all risk is eliminated. 
B. Ignore any remaining risk as “best effort controlled.” 
C. Ensure that any remaining risk is residual or low and accept the risk. 
D. Remove all controls.","The correct answer is C.
 Remember at the beginning of this chapter when I said the process of elimination may be your best bet in some cases? Well, even if you aren’t well-versed in risk management and security control efforts, you could narrow this down to the correct answer. It is impossible to remove all risk from any system and still have it usable. I’m certain there are exceptions to this rule (maybe super-secret machines in underground vaults buried deep within the earth, running on geothermal-powered batteries, without any network access at all and controlled by a single operator who hasn’t seen daylight in many years), but in general the goal of security teams has always been to reduce risk to an acceptable level."
A,A,"B is incorrect because, although it is mentioned as part of step 2, it’s actually secondary to scanning. Enumerating is used to gather more in-depth information about a target you already discovered by scanning. Things you might discover in scanning are IPs that respond to a ping. In enumerating each “live” IP, you might find open shares, user account information, and other goodies.","C is incorrect because reconnaissance and footprinting are interchangeable in CEH parlance. An argument can be made that footprinting is a specific portion of an overall recon effort; however, in all CEH documentation, these terms are used interchangeably.","D is incorrect because it references an attack. As usual, there’s almost always one answer you can throw out right away, and this is a prime example. We’re talking about step 2 in the methodology, where we’re still figuring out what targets are there and what vulnerabilities they may have. Attacking, at this point, is folly.","A Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) follows a specific methodology for testing a system. Which step comes after footprinting in the CEH methodology?
A. Scanning 
B. Enumeration 
C. Reconnaissance 
D. Application attack","The correct answer is A.
 CEH methodology is laid out this way: reconnaissance (footprinting), scanning and enumeration, gaining access, escalating privileges, maintaining access, and covering tracks. While you may be groaning about scanning and enumeration both appearing as answers, they’re placed here in this way on purpose. This exam is not only testing your rote memorization of the methodology but also how the methodology actually works. Remember, after scoping out the recon on your target, your next step is to scan it. After all, you have to know what targets are there first before enumerating information about them."
B,B,A is incorrect because a business continuity plan (BCP) contains all the procedures that should be followed in the event of an organizational outage—such as a natural disaster or a cyberattack. BCPs include the order in which steps should be taken and which system should be returned to service first. BCPs include DRPs (disaster recovery plans).,"C is incorrect because a disaster recovery plan (DRP) contains steps and procedures for restoring a specific resource (service, system, and so on) after an outage. Usually DRPs are part of a larger BCP.","D is incorrect because the annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is a mathematical measurement of the cost of replacing or repairing a specific resource. ALE is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). For example, if the total cost of a single loss of a resource is calculated at $1000 and you calculate there is a 10 percent chance it will fail in any given year, your ALE would be $100.","Your organization is planning for the future and is identifying the systems and processes critical for their continued operation. Which of the following best describes this effort?
A. BCP
B. BIA 
C. DRP 
D. ALE","The correct answer is B.
 A business impact analysis (BIA) best matches this description. In a BIA, the organization looks at all the systems and processes in use and determines which ones are absolutely critical to continued operation. Additionally, the assessor (the person or company conducting the analysis) will look at all the existing security architecture and make an evaluation on the likelihood of any system or resource being compromised. Part of this is assigning values to systems and services, determining the maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) for any, and identifying any overlooked vulnerabilities."
A,A,B is incorrect because the identification phase refers to the steps taken to verify the legitimacy of an active incident and gather information on the details of the attack.,C is incorrect because the containment phase deals with the steps taken to reduce or prevent the spread of the infection or attack inside the network.,D is incorrect because the recovery phase deals with the steps taken to restore and replace any resources damaged or affected by the attack footprint.,"Which incident response (IR) phase is responsible for setting rules, identifying the workforce and roles, and creating backup and test plans for the organization? 
A. Preparation 
B. Identification 
C. Containment 
D. Recovery","The correct answer is A.
 So even if you weren’t aware of incident response phases, this one should’ve been a rather easy guess. In the preparation phase, your IR (incident response) team should be preparing for an incident. Preparation includes lots of things—some of which are mentioned here. But virtually anything you can think of that does not involve actions taken during the incident belongs here. Training, exercises, and policies are all examples. As an aside, IR phases can be different depending on whom you ask and what the moon phase is, but generally IR is broken down into six phases: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Preparation we already covered. Identification refers to the steps taken to verify it’s actually an incident, and all the information surrounding that—source, destination(s), exploit used, malware used, and so on. Containment is the step used to cordon off the infected system(s) and prevent any further spread of infection or attack. Eradication refers to steps taken to remove the malware (or other attack-related residuals, such as backdoors). Recovery involves the steps taken to rebuild and restore the system(s) and network to pre-attack status (with better security, I might add). Finally, lessons learned is exactly what it sounds like, and it should feed right back into your organization’s preparation phase."
B,B,"A is incorrect because the textbook definition of a white-box test is one where all knowledge is provided to the pen tester up front—the test is designed to simulate an admin on your network who, for whatever reason, decides to go on the attack. For most pen testers, this test is really just unfair. It’s tantamount to sending them into the Roman Colosseum armed with a .50-caliber automatic weapon to battle a gladiator who is holding a knife.","C is incorrect because black-box testing indicates no knowledge at all. And if you think about it, the name is easy to correlate and remember: black = no light. Therefore, you can’t “see” anything. This is the test most people think about when it comes to hacking. You know nothing and are (usually) attacking from the outside.","D is incorrect because, as far as I can tell from the EC-Council’s documentation, there is no terminology for a “hybrid-box” test. This is a little tricky because the term hybrid is used elsewhere—for attacks and other things. If you apply a little common sense here, this answer is easy to throw out. If you know everything about the target, it’s white. If you know nothing, it’s black. If you’re in the middle, it’s gray. See?","You’ve been hired as part of a pen test team. During the brief, you learn the client wants the pen test attack to simulate a normal user who finds ways to elevate privileges and create attacks. Which test type does the client want? 
A. White box 
B. Gray box 
C. Black box 
D. Hybrid","The correct answer is B.
 A gray-box test is designed to replicate an inside attacker. Otherwise known as the partial knowledge attack (don’t forget this term), the idea is to simulate a user on the inside who might know a little about the network, directory structure, and other resources in your enterprise. You’ll probably find this one to be the most enlightening attack in out-briefing your clients in the real world—it’s amazing what you can get to when you’re a trusted, inside user. As an aside, you’ll often find in the real world that gray-box testing can also refer to a test where any inside information is given to a pen tester—you don’t necessarily need to be a fully knowledgeable inside user. In other words, if you have usable information handed to you about your client, you’re performing gray-box testing."
A,A,"B is incorrect because while authorized access control may sound great, it’s not a valid term.","C is incorrect because role-based access control can use MAC or discretionary access control to get the job done. With RBAC, the goal is to assign a role, and any entity holding that role can perform the duties associated with it. Users are not assigned permissions directly; they acquire them through their role (or roles). The roles are assigned to the user’s account, and each additional role provides its own unique set of permissions and rights.","D is incorrect because discretionary access control (DAC) allows the data owner, the user, to set security permissions for the object. If you’re on a Windows machine right now, you can create files and folders and then set sharing and permissions on them as you see fit. MAC administrators in the Department of Defense are shuddering at that thought right now.","Which of the following is defined as ensuring the enforcement of organizational security policy does not rely on voluntary user compliance by assigning sensitivity labels on information and comparing this to the level of security a user is operating at? 
A. Mandatory access control 
B. Authorized access control 
C. Role-based access control 
D. Discretionary access control","The correct answer is A.
 Access control is defined as the selective restraint of access to a resource, and there are several overall mechanisms to accomplish this goal. Mandatory access control (MAC) is one type that constrains the ability of a subject to access or perform an operation on an object by assigning and comparing “sensitivity labels.” Suppose a person (or a process) attempts to access or edit a file. With MAC, a label is placed on the file indicating its security level. If the entity attempting to access it does not have that level, or higher, then access is denied. With mandatory access control, security is centrally controlled by a security policy administrator, and users do not have the ability to override security settings. This should not be confused with role-based access control (RBAC) systems, which may actually use MAC to get the job done. The difference is in whether the information itself has a labeled description or whether the person accessing it has their own label. For example, in a classified area, the information classified as Top Secret will have a label on it identifying it as such, while you, as an auditor, will have your own clearance and need-to-know label allowing you to access certain information. MAC is a property of an object; RBAC is a property of someone accessing an object."
C,C,A is incorrect because the initial sequence number is set in the first step.,B is incorrect for the same reason—the ISN is set in the first step.,D is incorrect because this activity occurs in the second step.,"Which of the following statements is true regarding the TCP three-way handshake? 
A. The recipient sets the initial sequence number in the second step. 
B. The sender sets the initial sequence number in the third step. 
C. When accepting the communications request, the recipient responds with an acknowledgement and a randomly generated sequence number in the second step. 
D. When accepting the communications request, the recipient responds with an acknowledgement and a randomly generated sequence number in the third step.","The correct answer is C.
 The three-way handshake will definitely show up on your exam, and in much trickier wording than this. It’s easy enough to memorize “SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK,” but you’ll need more than that for the exam. In step 1, the host sends a segment to the server, indicating it wants to open a communications session. Inside this segment, the host turns on the SYN flag and sets an initial sequence number (any random 32-bit number). When the recipient gets the segment, it crafts a segment in response to let the host know it’s open and ready for the communications session. It does this by turning on the SYN and ACK flags, acknowledging the initial sequence number by incrementing it, and adding its own unique sequence number. Then, when the host gets this response back, it sends one more segment before the comm channel opens. In this segment, it sets the ACK flag and acknowledges the other’s sequence number by incrementing it. For example, suppose Host A is trying to open a channel with Server B.
 In this example, Host A likes the sequence number 2000, while Server B likes 5000. The first segment would look like this: SYN=1, ACK=0, ISN=2000. The response segment would look like this: SYN=1, ACK=1, ISN=5000, ACK NO=2001. The third and final segment would appear this way: SYN=0, ACK=1, SEQ NO=2001, ACK NO=5001."
D,D,"A is incorrect because this value equates to the ALE for the example. ALE = ARO × SLE. In this example, the ARO is 20 percent and the SLE is $1480: cost of a server ($1000) plus the cost of technician work to replace it ($80) plus lost time for workers (10 employees × 2 hours × $20 an hour, which works out to $400). Therefore, ALE = 20 percent × $1480, or $296.","B is incorrect because this value corresponds to the SLE for this scenario. The SLE is the total cost for a single loss, so we need to count the cost of the server, plus the cost of the technician’s hours, plus any downtime measurements for other workers. In this case, SLE = $1000 (cost of server) + $80 (server tech hours) + $400 (10 employees × 2 hours × $20 an hour), or $1480.",C is incorrect because this number doesn’t match the ARO for the example.,"Your network contains certain servers that typically fail once every five years. The total cost of one of these servers is $1000. Server technicians are paid $40 per hour, and a typical replacement requires two hours. Ten employees, earning an average of $20 per hour, rely on these servers, and even one of them going down puts the whole group in a wait state until it’s brought back up. Which of the following represents the ARO for a server? 
A. $296 
B. $1480 
C. $1000 
D. 0.20","The correct answer is D.
 When performing business impact analysis (or any other value analysis for that matter), the annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is an important measurement for every asset. To compute the ALE, multiply the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) by the single loss expectancy (SLE). The ARO is the frequency at which a failure occurs on an annual basis. In this example, servers fail once every five years, so the ARO would be 1 failure / 5 years = 20 percent."
A,A,"B is incorrect because although the attacker is one of the good guys (a white hat, proceeding with permission and an agreement in place), he is not provided with full knowledge of the system. In fact, it’s quite the opposite—according to the question he knows absolutely nothing about the system, making this particular “box” as black as it can be. A white-box target indicates one that the attacker already knows everything about. It’s lit up and wide open.","C is incorrect right off the bat because it references a black hat. Black-hat attackers are the bad guys—the ones proceeding without the target’s knowledge or permission. They usually don’t have inside knowledge of their target, so their attacks often start “black box.”","D is incorrect for the same reason just listed: because this attacker has permission to proceed and is operating under an agreement, he can’t be a black-box attacker. Additionally, this answer went the extra mile to convince you it was wrong—and missed on both swings. Not only is this a white-hat attacker, but the attack itself is black box. A gray-box attack indicates at least some inside knowledge of the target.","An ethical hacker is given no prior knowledge of the network and has a specific framework in which to work. The agreement specifies boundaries, nondisclosure agreements, and a completion date definition. Which of the following statements is true? 
A. A white hat is attempting a black-box test. 
B. A white hat is attempting a white-box test. 
C. A black hat is attempting a black-box test. 
D. A black hat is attempting a gray-box test.","The correct answer is A.
 I love these types of questions. Not only is this a two-for-one question, but it involves identical but confusing descriptors, causing all sorts of havoc. The answer to attacking such questions—and you will see them, by the way—is to take each section one at a time. Start with what kind of hacker he is. He’s hired under a specific agreement, with full knowledge and consent of the target, thus making him a white hat. That eliminates C and D right off the bat. Second, to address what kind of test he’s performing, simply look at what he knows about the system. In this instance, he has no prior knowledge at all (apart from the agreement), thus making it a black-box test."
A,A,B is incorrect because a concept of operations (CONOPS) isn’t detective in nature. A CONOPS defines what a system is and how it is supposed to be used.,C is incorrect because a procedure is a document the spells out specific step-by-step instructions for a given situation or process.,"D is incorrect because smartcard authentication is a preventive control, not a detective one. It’s designed to provide strong authentication, ideally preventing a problem in the first place. 
E is incorrect because a process can refer to a lot of different things, depending on your definition and viewpoint, but is not detective in nature as a control. A process, in general, refers to a set of steps or actions directed at accomplishing a goal.
","Which of the following is a detective control? 
A. Audit trail 
B. CONOPS 
C. Procedure 
D. Smartcard authentication 
E. Process","The correct answer is A.
 A detective control is an effort used to identify problems, errors, or (in the case of post-attack discovery) cause or evidence of an exploited vulnerability—and an audit log or trail is a perfect example. Ideally, detective controls should be in place and working such that errors can be corrected as quickly as possible. Many compliance laws and standards (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is one example) mandate the use of detective controls."
B,B,"A is incorrect because the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) isn’t designed to control the dissemination of PII or sensitive data. Its primary goal is to ensure the security of government systems by promoting a standardized approach to security controls, implementation, and testing. The act requires government agencies to create a security plan for their systems and to have it “accredited” at least once every three years","C is incorrect because the PATRIOT Act is not an effort to control personal information. Its purpose is to aid the U.S. government in preventing terrorism by increasing the government’s ability to monitor, intercept, and maintain records on almost every imaginable form of communication. As a side effect, it has also served to increase observation and prevention of hacking attempts on many systems.","D is incorrect because the Freedom of Information Act wasn’t designed to tell you what to do with information. Its goal is to define how you can get information— specifically information regarding how your governments work. It doesn’t necessarily help you in hacking, but it does provide a cover for a lot of information. Anything you uncover that could have been gathered through the Freedom of Information Act is considered legal and should be part of your overall test.","As part of a pen test on a U.S. government system, you discover files containing Social Security numbers and other sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). You are asked about controls placed on the dissemination of this information. Which of the following acts should you check? 
A. FISMA 
B. Privacy Act 
C. PATRIOT Act 
D. Freedom of Information Act","The correct answer is B.
 The Privacy Act of 1974 protects information of a personal nature, including Social Security numbers. The Privacy Act defines exactly what “personal information” is, and it states that government agencies cannot disclose any personal information about an individual without that person’s consent. It also lists 12 exemptions for the release of this information (for example, information that is part of a law enforcement issue may be released). In other questions you see, keep in mind that the Privacy Act generally will define the information that is not available to you during and after a test. Dissemination and storage of private information needs to be closely controlled to keep you out of hot water. As a side note, how you obtain PII is oftentimes just as important as how you protect it once discovered. In your real-world adventures, keep the Wiretap Act (18 U.S. Code Chapter 119—Wire and Electronic Communications Interception and Interception of Oral Communications) and others like it in mind."
B,B,"A is incorrect because in the Command and Control (C2) stage, a C2 channel is created to pass data and control information back and forth.","C is incorrect because in the Installation stage, the malware is actually installed on the target.","D is incorrect because in the Exploitation stage, a vulnerability is exploited via executing code on the target system.","In which step of the Cyber Kill Chain methodology would an adversary create a deliverable malicious payload? 
A. Command and Control (C2) 
B. Weaponization 
C. Installation 
D. Exploitation","The correct answer is B.
 Originally developed from a military model by Lockheed Martin (https:// lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) seeking to quantify how to identify, prepare to attack, engage, and destroy the cyber enemy target, the Cyber Kill Chain is a methodology for tracing the stages of a cyberattack. Covering everything from early reconnaissance to data exfiltration (or worse), it has evolved to help security professionals better understand and combat adversarial efforts. The methodology includes seven steps—Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control (C2), and Actions on Objectives—detailing an attack from inception to closure. In the Weaponization stage, adversaries create the deliverable malicious payload using an exploit, and in the next stage, Delivery, they send it merrily along the way."
C,C,"A is incorrect because the acceptance of risk means the organization understands the risk is there, but they don’t do anything about it. Why would a company take this action? Perhaps the chance a threat agent will (or even can) exploit the risk is so low it makes the effort to mitigate it pointless. Or it could be the cost to mitigate simply is more than any damage or recovery from exploitation in the first place. In any case, if the organization does nothing, they’re accepting risk.","B is incorrect because avoidance of risk means the organization takes steps to eliminate the service, action, or technology altogether. In other words, the risk is deemed so great the company would rather do without the asset or service in the first place. In the case of social engineering, unless the organization can work without employees, avoiding this risk is nearly impossible.","D is incorrect because transferring risk occurs when the organization puts the burden of risk on another party. For example, the company might hire an insurance company to pay off in the event a risk is exploited.","An organization’s leadership is concerned about social engineering and hires a company to provide training for all employees. How is the organization handling the risk associated with social engineering? 
A. They are accepting the risk. 
B. They are avoiding the risk. 
C. They are mitigating the risk. 
D. They are transferring the risk.","The correct answer is C.
 When it comes to risks, there are four different methods of attempting to deal with them. In risk mitigation, steps are taken to reduce the chance that the risk even will occur, and in this example that’s exactly what’s happening. Training on social engineering should help reduce the likelihood an employee will fall victim (real-life concerns on this notwithstanding—we are talking about test questions here)."
B,B,"A is incorrect because the reconnaissance phase is nothing more than the steps taken to gather evidence and information on the targets you want to attack. Activities that occur in this phase include dumpster diving and social engineering. Another valuable tool in recon is the Internet. Look for any of these items as key words in answers on your exam. Of course, in the real world, you may actually gather so much information in your recon you’ll already be way ahead of the game in identifying targets and whatnot, but when it comes to the exam, stick with the hard-and-fast boundaries they want you to remember and move on.","C is incorrect because the gaining access phase is all about attacking the machines themselves. You’ve already figured out background information on the client and have enumerated the potential vulnerabilities and security flaws on each target. In this phase, you break out the big guns and start firing away. Key words you’re looking for here are the attacks themselves: accessing an open and unsecured wireless access point, manipulating network devices, writing and delivering a buffer overflow, and performing SQL injection against a web application are all examples.","D is incorrect because this phase is all about backdoors and the steps taken to ensure you have a way back in. For the savvy readers out there who noticed I skipped a step here (escalating privileges), well done. Key words you’ll look for on this phase (maintaining access) are backdoors, zombies, and rootkits.
E is incorrect because this phase is all about cleaning up when you’re done and making sure no one can see where you’ve been. Clearing tracks involves steps to conceal success and avoid detection by security professionals. Steps taken here consist of removing or altering log files, concealing files via hidden attributes or directories, and even using tunneling protocols to communicate with the system.","In which phase of the ethical hacking methodology would a hacker be expected to discover available targets on a network? 
A. Reconnaissance 
B. Scanning and enumeration 
C. Gaining access 
D. Maintaining access 
E. Covering tracks","The correct answer is B.
 The scanning and enumeration phase is where you’ll use things such as ping sweeps to discover available targets on the network. This step occurs after reconnaissance. In this step, tools and techniques are actively applied to information gathered during recon to obtain more in-depth information on the targets. For example, reconnaissance may show a network subnet to have 500 or so machines connected inside a single building, whereas scanning and enumeration would discover which ones are Windows machines and which ones are running FTP. As an aside, it’s important to remember these phases and definitions are exactly what you’ll need to pass your exam, but in the real world, actions and findings don’t necessarily fit cleanly into predefined roles and definitions."
C,C,"A is incorrect because the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA; https://www.ftc.gov/ tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act) requires financial institutions—companies that offer consumers financial products or services such as loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance—to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data.

B,B,A and C are incorrect because air conditioning and fire alarms both fall into the category of physical control,D is incorrect because a security policy isn’t a logical or technical control.,,"Which of the following best defines a logical or technical control? 
A. Air conditioning 
B. Security tokens 
C. Fire alarms 
D. Security policy","The correct answer is B.
 A logical (or technical) control is one used for identification, authentication, and authorization. It can be embedded inside an operating system, application, or database management system. A security token (such as RSA’s SecureID) can provide a number that changes on a recurring basis that a user must provide during authentication, or it may provide a built-in number on a USB device that must be attached during authentication. A physical control is something, well, physical in nature, such as a lock or key or maybe a guard."
D,D,"A is incorrect because the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), also known as the Orange Book, was created by the Department of Defense (DoD) and defines and provides guidance on evaluating access controls within a system.

A,A,B is incorrect because black-box testing is designed to simulate the external threat. Black-box testing takes the most amount of time to complete because it means a thorough romp through the five stages of an attack (and removes any preconceived notions of what to look for) and is usually the most expensive option. Another drawback to this type of test is that it focuses solely on the threat outside the organization and does not take into account any trusted users on the inside.,"C is incorrect because a hat color refers to the attacker.

They illegally use their skills either for personal gain or for malicious intent, seeking to steal or destroy data or to deny access to resources and systems. Black hats do not ask for permission or consent.","As part of the preparation phase for a pen test you are participating in, the client relays their intent to discover security flaws and possible remediation. They seem particularly concerned about internal threats from the user base. Which of the following best describes the test type the client is looking for? 
A. Gray box 
B. Black box 
C. White hat 
D. Black hat","The correct answer is A.
 Once again, this is a play on words the exam will throw at you. Note the question is asking about a test type, not the attacker. Reviewing CEH documentation, you’ll see there are three types of tests—white, black, and gray—with each designed to test a specific threat. White tests the internal threat of a knowledgeable systems administrator or an otherwise elevated privilege level user. Black tests external threats with no knowledge of the target. Gray tests the average internal user threat to expose potential security problems inside the network."
D,D,"A is incorrect because the reconnaissance phase is all about gaining knowledge and information on a target. In reconnaissance, you’re learning about the target itself—for example, what system types they may have in use, what their operating hours are, whether they use a shredder, and what personal information about their employees is available. Think of reconnaissance as the background information on a good character in a novel; it may not be completely necessary to know before you read the action scenes, but it sure makes it easier to understand why the character behaves in a certain manner during the conflict phase of the book. Setting up zombie systems goes far beyond the boundaries of gathering information.","B is incorrect because this phase is where attackers attempt to conceal their success and avoid detection by security professionals. This can involve removing or altering log files, concealing files with via hidden attributes or directories, and using tunneling protocols to communicate with the system.","C is incorrect because in this phase attacks are leveled against the targets identified during the scanning and enumeration phase. Key words to look for in identifying this phase are the attacks themselves (such as buffer overflow and SQL injection). Finally, be careful about questions relating to elevating privileges. Sometimes this is counted as its own phase, so pay close attention to the question’s wording in choosing your answer.","In which phase of the attack would a hacker set up and configure “zombie” machines? 
A. Reconnaissance 
B. Covering tracks 
C. Gaining access 
D. Maintaining access","The correct answer is D.
 Zombies are basically machines hackers commandeer to do their work for them. If the attacker is really good, the owners of the zombie machines don’t even know their machines have been drafted into the war. There are a bajillion methods for maintaining access on a machine you’ve already compromised, and maintaining that access does not necessarily mean the system will be used as a zombie—you could, for example, simply want to check in from time to time to see what new juicy information the user has decided to leave in a file or folder for you, or to check on new logins, credentials, and so on. However, configuring zombie systems definitely belongs in this phase."
C,C,"A, B, and D are incorrect because all these are perfectly acceptable security policy entries. Exceptions to the policy and what happens to you should you decide not to follow the policy are expected entries. Also, supporting documents—such as various procedures, standards, and guidelines—are always referenced in the policy.",,,"Which of the following should not be included in a security policy? 
A. Policy exceptions 
B. Details on noncompliance disciplinary actions 
C. Technical details and procedures 
D. Supporting document references","The correct answer is C.
 The whole policy/standard/procedure/guideline thing can get confusing sometimes. A policy is a high-level document that doesn’t get down and dirty into technical details/specifications and is intended to improve awareness. Policies are mandatory, generally short, and easy to understand, providing everyone with the rules of the road. Standards are mandatory rules designed to support a policy, and they must include one or more specifications for hardware, software, or behavior. Procedures are step- by-step instructions for completing a task. Guidelines are not mandatory but rather are recommendations for accomplishing a goal or on how to act in a given situation."
A,A,B is incorrect because vulnerability management isn’t about responding to incidents, it’s about identifying and eradicating vulnerabilities before an incident can occur.,C is incorrect because change management involves implementing procedures or technologies to identify and implement required changes within a computer system.,"Which of the following is best defined as a set of processes used to identify, analyze, prioritize, and resolve security incidents? 
A. Incident management 
B. Vulnerability management 
C. Change management 
D. Patch management","The correct answer is A.
 Admittedly, this one is fairly easy—or at least it should be. Incident management is the process of dealing with incidents and generally always has the same features/ steps—identify the problem or root cause, analyze and research the issue, contain the malicious effort, eradicate the effort, and resolve any damage caused. ECC defines the process as having eight steps: 1. Preparation, 2. Detection and Analysis, 3. Classification/Prioritization, 4. Notification, 5. Containment, 6. Forensic Investigation, 7. Eradication and Recovery, and 8. Post-incident Activities. The incident response team (IRT) is charged with handling this process."
D,D,"A and B are incorrect because regardless of reporting, you should immediately stop testing. Anything you do after discovery not only could destroy evidence but actually put you at risk. Who’s to say you didn’t put the item in question on the system, or by your action cause it to be there? Rest assured the defense attorney will posit that argument, should it come to that.","C is incorrect because you’ve already agreed to perform this work, and refusing to speak with the client isn’t helping anything at all. Again, this needs to be addressed in the scope agreement up front, so there should be no surprises. It may well be that an employee has illegal stuff on their system, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the organization is complicit.",,"During an assessment, your pen test team discovers child porn on a system. Which of the following is the appropriate response? 
A. Continue testing and report findings at the out-brief. 
B. Continue testing but report findings to the business owners. 
C. Cease testing immediately and refuse to continue work for the client. 
D. Cease testing immediately and contact authorities.","The correct answer is D.
 I hesitated to add this question, for reasons that are obvious and some that aren’t, but in the interest of covering everything, I felt I must. First and foremost, in the real world, discovery of something that you think might be illegal activity puts you and your team in a very, very tricky spot. Should you accuse fill-in-the-blank of a crime and involve the authorities, you could be setting yourself up for lawsuits and all sorts of trouble. On the other hand, if you ignore it, you might be found complicit, or at the very least negligent. In the real world, the answer is to make sure your scope agreement advises you and the client of your duty regarding potential criminal activity found during the scope of your investigation. No guessing is allowed—it better be iron-clad evidence, obvious to all, or you’re in a world of hurt. Finally, what potentially illegal activity you discover may determine your response regardless of the ROE (rules of engagement). If you discover child porn, you could be guilty of a crime for not reporting it, which isn’t necessarily true for many other crimes. For example, if you witness someone breaking into a house across your street, or were performing a pen test and reasonably suspected someone had already compromised the network, you are not compelled by law, in most states, to notify authorities. However, if you witness bodily harm, you likely would be compelled by law in most states. Speaking purely academically, it’s fairly clear cut and will be so on your exam. In the real world, the true answer is to know the laws regarding your testing very well, and make sure your team has a good lawyer. In this example, however, the choices present make this relatively easy. ECC wants ethical hackers to report any illegal activity they find. Period. Possession of child porn is a crime no matter what, so again in this particular case, stop your testing and report it to the authorities."
A,A,"B is incorrect because this describes the management network zone. This zone is usually cordoned off specifically for infrastructure and management traffic. For obvious reasons, it’s highly secured. Look for “VLAN” and “IPSec” as keywords for this zone.","C is incorrect because this describes the DMZ. The demilitarized zone in military parlance refers to a section of land between two adversarial parties where there are no weapons and no fighting. The idea is you could see an adversary coming across and have time to work up a defense. In networking, the idea is the same: it’s a controlled buffer network between you and the uncontrolled chaos of the Internet. And keep in mind DMZs aren’t just between the Internet and a network; they can be anywhere an organization decides they want or need a buffer—inside or outside various internets and intranets. DMZ networks provide great opportunity for good security measures but can also sometimes become an Achilles’ heel when too much trust is put into their creation and maintenance.","D is incorrect because this describes the production network zone (PNZ). The PNZ is a very restricted zone that strictly controls direct access from uncontrolled zones. The PNZ supports functions and actions that must have strict access control. As an aside, the PNZ is not designed to hold users.","Which of the following best describes an intranet zone? 
A. A zone with few heavy security restrictions 
B. A highly secured zone, usually employing VLANs and encrypted communication channels 
C. A controlled buffer network between public and private networks 
D. A very restricted zone with no users","The correct answer is A.
 An intranet can be thought of, for testing purposes, as your own happy little networking safe space. It’s protected from outside attacks and interference by the DMZ and all the layers of security on the outside. Internally, you don’t assign loads of heavy security restrictions, because, as explained in the security versus usability discussion in the CEH All-in-One Exam Guide, Fifth Edition, as security increases, usability and functionality decrease. If your organization’s users are on the intranet, you want them as productive as possible, right?"
"B, D","B, D","A and C are both incorrect because they list the terms backward. Threats take advantage of vulnerabilities and exploit them, not the other way around.",,,"A machine in your environment uses an open X-server to allow remote access. The X-server access control is disabled, allowing connections from almost anywhere and with little to no authentication measures. Which of the following are true statements regarding this situation? (Choose all that apply.) 
A. An external vulnerability can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server threat. 
B. An external threat can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server vulnerability. 
C. An internal vulnerability can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server threat. 
D. An internal threat can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server vulnerability.","The correct answer is B, D.
 This is an easy one because all you have to understand are the definitions of threat and vulnerability. A threat is any agent, circumstance, or situation that could potentiality cause harm or loss to an IT asset. In this case, the implication is the threat is an individual (hacker) either inside or outside the network. A vulnerability is any weakness, such as a software flaw or logic design, that could be exploited by a threat to cause damage to an asset. In both these answers, the vulnerability—the access controls on the X-server are not in place—can be exploited by the threat, whether internal or external."
B,B,"A is incorrect because TTP refers to tactics, techniques, and procedures, which are the patterns of activity and methods associated with specific adversaries.",C is incorrect because APT refers to advanced persistent threat—a threat actor who gains unauthorized access to a resource and remains undetected for an extended period.,"D is incorrect because ABI refers to adversary behavioral identification, which involves efforts in identifying the common methods and techniques followed by adversaries.","Which of the following best describes forensic evidence indicating a potential intrusion or malicious activity? 
A. TTP 
B. IOC 
C. APT 
D. ABI","The correct answer is B.
 An indicator of compromise (IOC) describes the little clues and artifacts left behind on a resource that can indicate malicious intrusion or activity. Their existence in and of themselves might not mean anything; however, searching for known IOCs in your network can be a valuable security exercise to undertake. IOCs can come in many forms, some of which include privileged user activity anomalies, strange DNS requests, conflicting port application traffic, unusual registry or system file changes, and suspect web traffic and unusual network activity."
B,B,,,,"Which header field is used to reassemble fragmented IP packets? 
A. Destination address 
B.IP identification 
C.Don’t fragment bit 
D.ToS field","The correct answer is B.
 The destination address is used as the address to send messages to. The don’t fragment bit is used to tell network devices not to fragment the packet. The Type of Service (ToS) field can be used to perform quality of service. The IP identification field is used to identify fragments of the same packet, as they would all have the same IP identification number."
C,C,,,,"If you were to see the following in a packet capture, what would you expect was happening? ‘ or 1=1; 
A. Cross-site scripting 
B.Command injection 
C.SQL injection 
D.XML external entity injection","The correct answer is C.
 A SQL injection attack makes use of SQL queries, which can include logic that may alter the flow of the application. In the example provided, the intent is to force the result of the SQL query to always return a true. It is quoted the way it is to escape the existing query already in place in the application. None of the other attacks use a syntax that looks like the example."
C,C,,,,"What method might you use to successfully get malware onto a mobile device? 
A. Through the Apple Store or Google Play Store 
B.External storage on an Android 
C.Third-party app store 
D.Jailbreaking","The correct answer is C.
 The Apple App Store and the Google Play Store are controlled by Apple and Google. It’s not impossible to get malware onto mobile devices that way, but it’s very difficult because apps get run through a vetting process. While some Android devices will support external storage, it’s not an effective way to get malware onto a smartphone or other mobile device. Jailbreaking can lead to malware being installed but it’s not the means to get malware onto a mobile device. Third-party app stores can be a good means to get malware onto mobile devices because some third-party app stores don’t vet apps that are submitted."
B,B,,,,"What protocol is used to take a destination IP address and get a packet to a destination on the local network? 
A. DHCP 
B.ARP 
C.DNS 
D.RARP","The correct answer is B.
 DHCP is used to get IP configuration to endpoints. DNS is used to resolve a hostname to an IP address and vice versa. RARP is the reverse address protocol used to take a MAC address and resolve it to an IP address. ARP is used to resolve an IP address to a MAC address. Communication on a local network requires the use of a MAC address. The IP address is used to get to systems off the local network."
C,C,,,,"What would be the result of sending the string AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA into a variable that has been allocated space for 8 bytes? 
A. Heap spraying 
B.SQL injection 
C.Buffer overflow 
D.Slowloris attack","The correct answer is C.
 Heap spraying uses dynamically allocated space to store attack code. A slowloris attack is used to hold open web server connection buffers. A SQL injection will be used to inject SQL queries to the database server. A buffer overflow sends more data into the application than space has been allocated for."
B,B,,,,"If you were to see the subnet mask 255.255.248.0, what CIDR notation (prefix) would you use to indicate the same thing? 
A. /23 
B./22 
C./21 
D./20","The correct answer is B.
 A /23 network would be 255.255.254.0. A /22 would be 255.255.252. A /20 would be 255.255.240.0. Only a /21 would give you a 255.255.248.0 subnet mask."
C,C,,,,"What is the primary difference between a worm and a virus? 
A. A worm uses polymorphic code 
B. A virus uses polymorphic code 
C. A worm can self-propagate 
D. A virus can self-propagate","The correct answer is C.
 Both worms and viruses could be written to use polymorphic code, which means they could modify what they look like as they propagate. A worm, though, could self-propagate. It’s the one distinction between worms and viruses. Viruses require some intervention on the part of the user to propagate and execute."
A,A,,,,"How would you calculate risk? 
A. Probability * loss 
B.Probability * mitigation factor 
C.(Loss + mitigation factor) * (loss/probability) 
D.Probability * mitigation factor","The correct answer is A.
 Risk is the probability of the occurrence of an event multiplied by the dollar value of loss. There is no mitigation factor that is quantified so it could be put into a risk ­calculation."
B,B,,,,"How does an evil twin attack work? 
A. Phishing users for credentials 
B.Spoofing an SSID 
C.Changing an SSID 
D.Injecting four-way handshakes","The correct answer is B.
 An evil twin attack uses an access point masquerading to be the point of connection for stations trying to connect to a legitimate wireless network. Stations reach out to make connections to this access point masquerading as another access point. While you may phish for credentials as part of an evil twin attack, credential phishing is not how evil twin attacks work. SSIDs don’t get changed as part of an evil twin attack, meaning no SSID that exists will become another SSID.
 Injecting four-way handshakes won’t do much, since four- way assumes both ends are communicating, so the injection of a full communication stream will get ignored."
C,C,,,,"In order to remove malware in the network before it gets to the endpoint, you would use which of the following? 
A. Antivirus 
B.Application layer gateway 
C.Unified threat management appliance 
D.Stateful firewall","The correct answer is C.
 Antivirus solutions are used on endpoints or maybe on email servers. Stateful firewalls add in the ability to factor in the state of the connection—new, related, established. An Application layer gateway knows about Application layer protocols. A unified threat management appliance adds additional capabilities on top of firewall functions, including antivirus."
A,A,,,,"What is the purpose of a security policy? 
A. Providing high-level guidance on the role of security 
B.Providing specific direction to security workers 
C.Increasing the bottom line of a company 
D.Aligning standards and practices","The correct answer is A.
 Standards and practices should be derived from a security policy, which is the high- level guidance on the role of security within an organization. Security does not generally increase the bottom line of a company. Policies are not for providing specific directions, which would be the role of procedures."
B. Base64 encoding takes non-printable characters and encodes them in a way that they can be rendered in text. Encryption would generally render text unreadable to people. A cryptographic hash is a way of generating a fixed-length value to identify a value. URL encoding takes text and uses hexadecimal values to represent the characters. This is text that has been converted into hexadecimal so they can be used in a URL.,B,1,,,What has been done to the following string? %3Cscript%3Ealert(‘wubble’),"The correct answer is %3C/ script%3E A.

B,B,,,,"What would you get from running the command dig ns domain.com? 
A. Mail exchanger records for domain.com 
B.Name server records for domain.com 
C.Caching name server for domain.com 
D.IP address for the hostname ns","The correct answer is B.
 Mail exchanger records would be identified as MX records. A name server record is identified with the tag NS. While an enterprise may have one or even several caching name servers, the caching name server wouldn’t be said to belong to the domain since it doesn’t have any domain identification associated with it."
C,C,,,,"What technique would you ideally use to get all of the hostnames associated with a domain? 
A. DNS query 
B.Zone copy 
C.Zone transfer 
D.Recursive request","The correct answer is C.
 A DNS query can be used to identify an IP address from a hostname or vice versa. You could potentially use a brute-force technique to identify hostnames, though you may not get everything using that method. A recursive request is common from a caching server to get an authoritative response. The term for getting all the contents of the zone is a zone transfer."
A,A,,,,"If you were to notice operating system commands inside a DNS request while looking at a packet capture, what might you be looking at? 
A. Tunneling attack 
B.DNS amplification 
C.DNS recursion 
D.XML entity injection","The correct answer is A.
 Tunneling attacks can be used to hide one protocol inside another. This may be used to send operating system commands using a tunnel system. A DNS amplification attack is where a small DNS request results in much larger responses sent to the target. DNS recur- sion is used to look up information from DNS servers. An XML entity injection attack is a web-based attack and wouldn’t be found inside a DNS request."
D,D,,,,"What would be the purpose of running a ping sweep? 
A. You want to identify responsive hosts without a port scan. 
B.You want to use something that is light on network traffic. 
C.You want to use a protocol that may be allowed through the firewall. 
D.All of the above.","The correct answer is D.
 There may be several reasons for performing a ping sweep. You likely want to identify responsive hosts on the network segment you are targeting. You may not, though, want to use a full port scan. ICMP is a lightweight protocol and there is a chance it will be allowed through the firewall, since it’s used for troubleshooting and diagnostics."
C,C,,,,"How many functions are specified by NIST’s cybersecurity framework? 
A. 0 
B.3 
C.5 
D.4","The correct answer is C.
 The NIST cybersecurity framework specifies five functions—identify, protect, detect, response, recover."
B,B,,,,"What would be one reason not to write malware in Python? 
A. Python interpreter is slow. 
B.Python interpreter may not be available. 
C.There is inadequate library support. 
D.Python is a hard language to learn.","The correct answer is B.
 Python interpreters may be considered to be slower to execute than a compiled program, however the difference is negligible and generally speed of execution isn’t much of a con- cern when it comes to malware. Python is not a hard language to learn and there are a lot of community-developed libraries. One challenge, though, is that you may need a Python interpreter, unless you go through the step of getting a Python compiler and compiling your script. Windows systems wouldn’t commonly have a Python interpreter installed."
B,B,,,,"If you saw the following command line, what would you be capturing? tcpdump -i eth2 host 192.168.10.5 
A. Traffic just from 192.168.10.5 
B.Traffic to and from 192.168.10.5 
C.Traffic just to 192.168.10.5 
D.All traffic other than from 192.168.86.5","The correct answer is B.
 The expression host 192.168.10.5 is BPF indicating that tcpdump should only capture packets to and from 192.168.10.5. If you wanted to only get it to or from, you would need to modify host with src or dest."
C,C,,,,"What is Diffie-Hellman used for? 
A. Key management 
B.Key isolation 
C.Key exchange 
D.Key revocation","The correct answer is C.
 Certificates can be revoked but that’s not what Diffie-Hellman is used for. Key man­ agement is a much broader topic than what Diffie-Hellman is used for. Diffie-Hellman is used for key exchange. It is a process that allows parties to an encrypted conversation to mutually derive the same key starting with the same base value."
D,D,,,,"Which social engineering principle may allow a phony call from the help desk to be effective? 
A. Social proof 
B.Imitation 
C.Scarcity 
D.Authority","The correct answer is D.
 While you might be imitating someone, imitation is not a social engineering principle. Neither social proof nor scarcity are at play in this situation. However, if you are calling from the help desk, you may be considered to be in a position of authority."
D,D,,,,"How do you authenticate with SNMPv1? 
A. Username/password 
B.Hash 
C.Public string 
D.Community string","The correct answer is D.
 SNMPv3 implemented username and password authentication. With version 1, you used a cleartext community string. SNMP doesn’t use hashes and while the word “pub- lic” is often used as a community string, a public string is not a way to authenticate with SNMPv1."
A,A,,,,"What is the process Java programs identify themselves to if they are sharing procedures over the network? 
A. RMI registry 
B.RMI mapper 
C.RMI database 
D.RMI process","The correct answer is A.
 Interprocess communications across systems using a network is called remote method invocation. The process that programs have to communicate with to get a dynamic port allocation is the RMI registry. This is the program you query to identify services that are available on a system that has implemented RMI."
C,C,,,,"What do we call an ARP response without a corresponding ARP request? 
A. Is-at response 
B.Who-has ARP 
C.Gratuitous ARP 
D.IP response","The correct answer is C.
 When an ARP response is sent without a corresponding ARP request, it’s an unexpected or unnecessary message, so it is a gratuitous ARP."
D,D,,,,"What are the three times that are typically stored as part of file metadata? 
A. Moves, adds, changes 
B.Modified, accessed, deleted 
C.Moved, accessed, changed 
D.Modified, accessed, created","The correct answer is D.
 There are three date and time stamps commonly used in file metadata. When the file is created, that moment is stored. When a file is accessed by a user, that moment is stored. When a file is modified, that moment is stored. Accessed is not the same as modified since accessing a file could be read-only. You could open a file, expecting to modify it but not ending up doing the modification. The access time still changes. While moves, adds, and changes may sometimes be referred to as MAC like modified, accessed, and created, those are not tasks associated with file times."
C,C,,,,"Which of these is a reason to use an exploit against a local vulnerability? 
A. Pivoting 
B.Log manipulation 
C.Privilege escalation 
D.Password collection","The correct answer is C.
 Local vulnerabilities are used against applications that are not listening on the network. This means they require you to be “local” to the machine and not remote. In other words, you have to be logged in somehow. A local vulnerability would not be used to collect pass- words since you don’t need a vulnerability to do that. Similarly, you don’t need to make use of a vulnerability to manipulate logs or to pivot. Most of those would require you to have elevated permissions, though. A local vulnerability may be exploited to get you those elevated permissions."
A,A,,,,"What principle is used to demonstrate that a signed message came from the owner of the key that signed it? 
A. Non-repudiation 
B.Non-verifiability 
C.Integrity 
D.Authority","The correct answer is A.
 Integrity is part of the CIA triad but isn’t the principle that ties a signed message back to the subject of the signing certificate. Non-verifiability is nonsense and authority isn’t rel- evant here. Instead, non-repudiation means someone can’t say they didn’t send a message if it was signed with their key and that key was in their possession and password-protected."
D,D,,,,"What is a viable approach to protecting against tailgaiting? 
A. Biometrics 
B.Badge access 
C.Phone verification 
D.Man traps","The correct answer is D.
 Biometrics and badge access are forms of physical access control. Phone verification could possibly be used as a way of verifying identity but it won’t protect against tailgating. A man trap, however, will protect against tailgating because a man trap only allows one person in at a time."
B,B,,,,"Why is bluesnarfing potentially more dangerous than bluejacking? 
A. Bluejacking sends while bluesnarfing receives. 
B.Bluejacking receives while bluesnarfing sends. 
C.Bluejacking installs keyloggers. 
D.Bluesnarfing installs keyloggers.","The correct answer is B.
 Bluesnarfing is an attack that connects to a Bluetooth device in order to grab data from that device. Bluejacking can be used to send information to a Bluetooth device that is receiving from the attacker, such as a text message. Neither of these attacks install keylog- gers. The victim device sends information to the attacker in a bluesnarfing attack."
B,B,,,,"Which of the security triad properties does the Biba security model relate to? 
A. Confidentiality 
B.Integrity 
C.Availability 
D.All of them","The correct answer is B.
 The Biba security model covers data integrity. While other models cover confidentiality, none of them cover availability."
A,A,,,,"Which of these devices would not be considered part of the Internet of Things? 
A. Smartphone 
B.Thermostat 
C.Light bulb 
D.Set-top cable box","The correct answer is A.
 A thermostat is an embedded device without a traditional user interface. A light bulb would have no user interface, even if it has network capabilities. A set-top cable box would have a custom interface and not a general-purpose one. The only device here that is a general-purpose computing platform with a traditional user interface—screen and keyboard—is the smartphone, so it isn’t part of the IoT."
D,D,,,,"If you wanted a lightweight protocol to send real-time data over, which of these would you use? 
A. TCP 
B.HTTP 
C.ICMP 
D.UDP","The correct answer is D.
 TCP uses a three-way handshake, which is fairly heavyweight. HTTP uses TCP and adds more on top of it. ICMP is used for control messages. UDP has very little overhead and is commonly used for real-time data transport."
B,B,,,,"What order, from bottom to top, does the TCP/IP architecture use? 
A. Network Access, Network, Transport, Application 
B.Link, Internet, Transport, Application 
C.Physical, Network, Session, Application 
D.Data Link, Internet, Transport, Application","The correct answer is B.
 From top to bottom, the TCP/IP architecture is Link, Internet, Transport, and Application. B is the only answer that reflects that."
B,B,,,,"Which of these services would be considered a storage as a service solution? 
A. Microsoft Azure 
B.iCloud 
C.Google Compute 
D.DropLeaf","The correct answer is B.
 While Microsoft Azure and Google Compute have storage capabilities, they aren’t storage as a service solutions. Drop leaf is a type of table. Dropbox is a storage as a service solution. The only one listed here that is storage as a solution is iCloud, which is Apple’s cloud storage platform."
B,B,,,,"The UDP headers contain which of the following fields? 
A. Source address, destination address, checksum, length 
B.Destination port, source port, checksum, length 
C.Flags, source port, destination port, checksum 
D.Length, checksum, flags, address","The correct answer is B.
 The IP headers include addresses. UDP headers use ports. TCP headers use flags, but UDP headers do not. The UDP headers have the source and destination port fields along with checksum and length."
C,C,,,,"What are the three steps in the TCP handshake as described by the flags set? 
A. SYN, SYN/URG, RST 
B.RST, SYN, ACK 
C.SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK 
D.SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK/URG","The correct answer is C.
 The three-way handshake is used to establish a connection. The first message has the SYN flag set and includes the sequence number. The response from the server has the ACK flag set for the SYN message that was sent from the client. The acknowledgment number is set. Additionally, in the same message, the server sends its own SYN flag and sequence number. The client then responds with an ACK message. So, the sequence is SYN, SYN/ACK, and ACK."
D,D,,,,"Which of these protocols would be used to communicate with an IoT device? 
A. ICMP 
B.SMTP 
C.Telnet 
D.HTTP","The correct answer is D.
 While ICMP may be used as part of passing control messages in case of errors in the network, it wouldn’t be used between the IoT device and a server. SMTP is an email protocol that also wouldn’t be used. Telnet is a cleartext protocol used to gain command- line access to a system. HTTP would commonly be used to pass messages between a controlling server and an IoT device."
D,D,,,,"Which network topology are you most likely to run across in a large enterprise network? 
A. Ring topology 
B.Bus topology 
C.Full mesh 
D.Star-bus hybrid","The correct answer is D.
 Ring networks were once common but are much less so now. You may find a ring network in a service provider network today. A bus topology is best suited for a smaller network. Full mesh isn’t a very common topology, in part because of the expense and complexity it brings. A star-bus hybrid would be common. An enterprise would use multiple switches that were all connected to one another over a bus, while all the endpoints would connect to the switch in a star topology."
B,B,,,,"If you were to see the subnet mask 255.255.252.0, what CIDR notation (prefix) would you use to indicate the same thing? 
A. /23 
B./22 
C./21 
D./20","The correct answer is B.
 A /23 network would be 255.255.254.0. A /21 would be 255.255.248. A /20 would be 255.255.240.0. Only a /22 would give you a 255.255.252.0 subnet mask."
C,C,,,,"Which of these addresses would be considered a private address (RFC 1918 address)? 
A. 172.128.10.5 
B.9.10.10.7 
C.172.20.128.240 
D.250.28.17.10","The correct answer is C.
 The RFC 1918 address blocks are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. The only address listed that fits into one of those address blocks is 172.20.128.240. The address block is 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255."
A,A,,,,"If you were looking for the definitive documentation on a protocol, what would you consult? 
A. Request for Comments 
B.Manual pages 
C.Standards 
D.IEEE","The correct answer is A.
 Manual pages provide documentation for commands and programs. IEEE is the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which does manage some protocols but isn’t documentation itself. Standards on the Internet are actually uncommon and only happen after a very long period of time. The best place to find definitive documentation about protocols seen on the Internet is in the Request for Comments (RFC) documents."
D,D,,,,"The PDU for TCP is called a 
A. Packet 
B.Datagram 
C.Frame 
D.Segment","The correct answer is D.
 At the Network layer, the PDU is a packet. The Network layer is IP. At the Data Link layer, the PDU is a frame. Commonly, the protocol would be Ethernet there. UDP uses datagram as the PDU. TCP uses segment for the PDU."
B,B,,,,"Which header field is used to reassemble fragmented IP packets? 
A. Source address 
B.IP identification 
C.Don’t fragment bit 
D.Acknowledgment field","The correct answer is B.
 The source address is used as the address to send back to on the response, making it the destination address. The don’t fragment bit is used to tell network devices not to fragment the packet. The acknowledgment field is part of the TCP header and not the IP header. The IP identification field is used to identify fragments of the same packet, as they would all have the same IP identification number."
C,C,,,,"Which protocol is necessary to enable the functionality of traceroute? 
A. HTTP 
B.SNMP 
C.ICMP 
D.IP","The correct answer is C.
 The traceroute program uses UDP messages with the time to live field starting at 1. This is incremented for each hop in the network until the destination is reached. Each device would send an ICMP time exceeded in transit message back to indicate the TTL had expired. The source of that message indicates the address of the network hop. On Windows systems, tracert uses ICMP echo request messages, also incrementing the time to live value. Because of these two factors, traceroute requires ICMP to work."
D,D,,,,"What is a MAC address used for? 
A. Addressing systems over a VPN 
B.Addressing systems through a tunnel 
C.Addressing systems over TCP 
D.Addressing systems on the local network","The correct answer is D.
 Systems over a VPN may use a MAC address but they may also use IP addresses. The same would be true for a tunnel. Using TCP, we would use ports for addressing. On the local network, the MAC address is used."
C,C,,,,"To remove malware from the network before it gets to the endpoint, you would use which of the following? 
A. Packet filter 
B.Application layer gateway 
C.Unified threat management appliance 
D.Stateful firewall","The correct answer is C.
 Packet filters are used to make block/allow decisions based on header data like source and destination address and port. Stateful firewalls add in the ability to factor in the state of the connection—new, related, established. An Application layer gateway knows about Application layer protocols. A unified threat management appliance adds additional capabilities on top of firewall functions, including antivirus."
D,D,,,,"If you were on a client engagement and discovered that you left an external hard drive with essential data on it at home, which security principle would you be violating? 
A. Confidentiality 
B.Integrity 
C.Non-repudiation 
D.Availability","The correct answer is D.
 Confidentiality is about making sure secrets are kept secret. Integrity makes sure that data isn’t altered accidentally or by an unauthorized agent. Non-repudiation makes sure someone can’t say a message didn’t originate with them if it came from their identity. Availability means making sure data is where it needs to be when it should be there. This includes services as well."
A,A,,,,"How would you calculate risk? 
A. Probability * loss value 
B.Probability * mitigation factor 
C.(Loss value + mitigation factor) * (loss value/probability) 
D.Probability * mitigation factor","The correct answer is A.
 Risk is the probability of the occurrence of an event multiplied by the dollar value of loss. There is no mitigation factor that is quantified, so it could be put into a risk calculation."
D,D,,,,"Which of the following is one factor of a defense in depth approach to network design? 
A. Switches 
B.Using Linux on the desktop 
C.Optical cable connections 
D.Access control lists on routers","The correct answer is D.
 Switches and optical cable connections can certainly be part of a network design, but in and of themselves they don’t add any security features. You may use Linux on the desktop, but without more of a strategy for patch and vulnerability management, Linux is no better than other operating systems. Access control lists on routers can add an additional layer of security, especially when combined with other elements like firewalls and intrusion detection systems."
B,B,,,,"How would you ensure that confidentiality is implemented in an organization? 
A. Watchdog processes 
B.Encryption 
C.Cryptographic hashes 
D.Web servers","The correct answer is B.
 Confidentiality is keeping secret information secret, which means unauthorized users can’t access it. Encryption is a good way to keep unauthorized users from data because in order to get to the data, they need to have the key. Watchdog processes are used to ensure that programs remain running. Cryptographic hashes are used to verify the integrity of data. Web servers are used to serve up information."
C,C,,,,"An intrusion detection system can perform which of the following functions? 
A. Block traffic 
B.Filter traffic based on headers 
C.Generate alerts on traffic 
D.Log system messages","The correct answer is C.
 Firewalls are used to block traffic into a network, though an intrusion prevention system will also block traffic. A packet filtering firewall uses header information, such as source and destination address and port, to determine whether to allow traffic into the network. Syslog and the Windows event subsystem can be used to log system messages. Intrusion detection systems can be used to generate alerts on traffic."
D,D,,,,"Which of these would be an example of a loss of integrity? 
A. User making changes to a file and saving it 
B.Bad blocks flagged on disk 
C.Credit cards passed in cleartext 
D.Memory failures causing disk drivers to run incorrectly","The correct answer is D.
 If a user makes a change to a file and saves it, that’s an intentional act and the data is what the user expects and wants. If the disk drive has flagged bad blocks on the disk, the drive won’t write any data out to those blocks, so there will be no loss of integrity. Credit cards passed in cleartext would be a violation of confidentiality. Memory failures, though, could cause a loss of data integrity, even in the case of writing data to the drive. The corrupted data in memory could be written to disk. Also, memory failures may cause issues with the disk driver, which may also cause data corruption."
A,A,,,,"What would you use a security information event manager for? 
A. Aggregating and providing search for log data 
B.Managing security projects 
C.Escalating security events 
D.Storing open-source intelligence","The correct answer is A.
 Security information event managers are used to aggregate event data, such as log information. Once the data has been aggregated, it can be searched and correlated. Even though it’s called an event manager, it isn’t used to manage security projects, nor is it used to escalate security events. Other tools can be used to gather and store open-source intelligence."
C,C,,,,"Why is it important to store system logs remotely? 
A. Local systems can’t handle it. 
B.Bandwidth is faster than disks. 
C.Attackers might delete local logs. 
D.It will defend against attacks.","The correct answer is C.
 Commonly, system logs are stored on the system that generated the log message. Certainly local systems can handle the logs they have generated. Log messages don’t typically consume a lot of space at an individual message level, so bandwidth isn’t a problem. Transmitting over a network is generally not faster than moving data within local disks. System logs can be used in identifying attacks, but the logs won’t defend against attacks. However, if an attacker does compromise a system, the attacker may delete the local logs because they could get access to them."
B,B,,,,"What would be necessary for a TCP conversation to be considered ESTABLISHED by a stateful firewall? 
A. Final acknowledgment message 
B.Three-way handshake complete 
C.Sequence numbers aligned 
D.SYN message received","The correct answer is B.
 In TCP, a three-way handshake is used to synchronize sequence numbers and establish a connection. While the sequence numbers are shared, they wouldn’t be called aligned, which might suggest that each end was using the same sequence number. A SYN message is part of the three-way handshake, but it is not sufficient to establish a connection. Option A, “Final acknowledgment message,” is ambiguous. It could refer to the acknowledgment to a FIN message, closing the connection."
A,A,,,,"What is the purpose of a security policy? 
A. To provide high-level guidance on the role of security 
B.To provide specific direction to security workers 
C.To increase the bottom line of a company 
D.To align standards and practices","The correct answer is A.
 Standards and practices should be derived from a security policy, which is the high- level guidance on the role of security within an organization. Security does not generally increase the bottom line of a company. Policies are not for providing specific directions, which would be the role of procedures."
C,C,,,,"What additional properties does the Parkerian hexad offer over the CIA triad? 
A. Confidentiality, awareness, authenticity 
B.Utility, awareness, possession 
C.Utility, possession, authenticity 
D.Possession, control, authenticity","The correct answer is C.
 The Parkerian hexad takes the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the CIA triad and adds utility, possession (or control), and authenticity."
D,D,,,,"What important event can be exposed by enabling auditing? 
A. System shutdown 
B.Service startup 
C.Package installation 
D.User login","The correct answer is D.
 While system shutdown, service startup, and package installation may be events that are logged, they are generally logged by normal system logging. Auditing functions are different between Windows and Linux/Unix, but audit systems for both will generate logs when a user logs into a system."
B,B,,,,"What can an intrusion prevention system do that an intrusion detection system can’t? 
A. Generate alerts 
B.Block or reject network traffic 
C.Complete the three-way handshake to bogus messages 
D.Log packets","The correct answer is B.
 While an intrusion prevention system can generate alerts, so can an intrusion detection system. Both systems may also be able to log packets, as needed. A bogus message likely wouldn’t result in a completed three-way handshake, and the handshake shouldn’t be completed anyway. An intrusion prevention system can, however, block or reject network traffic, while an intrusion detection system can’t."
A,A,,,,"Which of these is an example of an application layer gateway? 
A. Web application firewall 
B.Runtime application self-protection 
C.Java applet 
D.Intrusion prevention system","The correct answer is A.
 Runtime application self-protection is a plug-in used on an application server to prevent bad messages from impacting the application. A Java applet is an implementation of a Java program. An intrusion prevention system is used to detect and block potential intrusions. A web application firewall, however, makes decisions based on Application layer traffic and will either allow or block that traffic. This makes it an Application layer gateway."
C,C,,,,"Which information would a packet filter use to make decisions about what traffic to allow into the network? 
A. HTTP REQUEST message 
B.Ethernet type 
C.UDP source port 
D.SNMP OID","The correct answer is C.
 A packet filter would use layer 2/3/4 headers to make decisions. An HTTP REQUEST message is at the Application layer (layer 7). Ethernet type isn’t used to make decisions in a packet filter. SNMP OID is also an Application layer message. A packet filter would, though, use source or destination ports, potentially, to make decisions about allowing or blocking a packet."
C,C,,,,"Which of the following products might be used as an intrusion detection system? 
A. Elastic Stack 
B.Prewikka 
C.Snort 
D.Snorby","The correct answer is C.
 ElasticStack is an implementation of a security information event manager. Prewikka can be used along with an intrusion detection system as a dashboard. Snorby is an auxiliary program used with Snort. Snort is an intrusion detection program."
D,D,,,,"Which of these isn’t an example of an attack that compromises integrity? 
A. Buffer overflow 
B.Man in the middle 
C.Heap spraying 
D.Watering hole","The correct answer is D.
 A buffer overflow attack is used to execute attacker-supplied code by altering the return address in the stack. A man in the middle attack can be used to intercept and potentially alter a conversation between two systems. A heap spraying attack sends a lot of data into the heap to overwrite what’s there. A watering hole attack does not compromise integrity since its purpose is to introduce malware to a system. The malware might eventually compromise integrity, but the watering hole attack itself does not."
B,B,,,,"What type of attack is a compromise of availability? 
A. Watering hole 
B.DoS 
C.Phishing 
D.Buffer overflow","The correct answer is B.
 A watering hole attack looks to compromise a system that visits a website. A phishing attack looks to gather information from victims, potentially by compromising the victim’s system. A buffer overflow attack tries to introduce code provided by the attacker. A denial of service attack, however, has the intention of making a service unavailable for users."
C,C,,,,"If you were implementing defense in breadth, what might you do? 
A. Install multiple firewalls 
B.Install intrusion detection systems 
C.Introduce a DevSecOps culture 
D.Ensure policies are up to date","The correct answer is C.
 Installing multiple firewalls and intrusion detection systems and ensuring that policies are up to date are all elements of a defense in depth approach. Introducing a DevSecOps culture may be an attempt to reduce the number of vulnerabilities and also get them resolved more quickly. As such, it might be considered defense in breadth."
B,B,,,,"If you were checking on the IP addresses for a company in France, what RIR would you be checking with for details? 
A. ARIN 
B.RIPE 
C.AfriNIC 
D.LACNIC","The correct answer is B.
 France is in Europe, and as such, it falls under the jurisdiction of RIPE. ARIN handles North America. AfriNIC handles Africa, and LACNIC handles Latin America and parts of the Caribbean."
D,D,,,,"You need to identify all Excel spreadsheets available from the company Example, Inc., whose domain is example.com. What search query would you use? 
A. site:example.com files:pdf 
B.site:excel files:xls 
C.domain:example.com filetype:xls 
D.site:example.com filetype:xls","The correct answer is D.
 The keyword site indicates the site (or domain) you want to search in. You need to provide either a domain, which would catch all FQDNs in that domain that were available in the search database, or a specific hostname. The keyword filetype indicates the file extension for the results. This keyword requires that a file extension be provided. There is no files or domain keyword that can be used in Google or other search engines."
A,A,,,,"If you found a colleague searching at pgp.mit.edu, what would they likely be looking for? 
A. Email addresses 
B.Company keys 
C.Executive names 
D.Privacy policies","The correct answer is A.
 PGP uses public servers and shared verification to store and validate keys and key ownership. Keys are owned by individuals, as a general rule. If someone were searching at pgp.mit.edu, they would likely be looking for people and, most specifically, email addresses."
D,D,,,,"What information could you get from running p0f? 
A. Local time 
B.Remote time 
C.Absolute time 
D.Uptime","The correct answer is D.
 p0f can provide the uptime for some systems. Packets don’t include any time information, so it’s not possible to gather local or remote time. Absolute time would be based in a particular time zone, and time zones aren’t communicated at the Network or Data Link layers."
C,C,,,,"The DNS server where records for a domain belonging to an organization or enterprise reside is called the _______ server. 
A. Caching 
B.Recursive 
C.Authoritative 
D.Local","The correct answer is C.
 A local caching server is what most people use to perform DNS lookups from their systems in order to get better performance. Recursion is the process used to look up DNS addresses from a caching server. Eventually, the caching server would ask an authoritative server for the information."
A,A,,,,"What strategy does a local, caching DNS server use to look up records when asked? 
A. Recursive 
B.Serial 
C.Combinatorics 
D.Bistromathics","The correct answer is A.
 DNS requests from a local caching server start with the cache, then move to root servers and then subsequent servers, always getting closer to the final destination. This process of asking a question, getting an answer, and asking again using the new information is called recursion. Neither serial nor combinatorics make sense in this context, and bistromathics is a field of study invented by Douglas Adams for the book Life, the Universe and Everything."
B,B,,,,"What would you use a job listing for when performing reconnaissance? 
A. Executive staff 
B.Technologies used 
C.Phishing targets 
D.Financial records","The correct answer is B.
 It would be unusual to find executive staff identified in a job listing. It may be possible to get phishing targets, but it’s not guaranteed, and a single individual usually isn’t identified. No financial records would be available in a job listing. Technologies used at a company, though, would be identified in order to ensure that the applicant has the right experience."
D,D,,,,"What tool could be used to gather email addresses from PGP servers: Bing, Google, or LinkedIn? 
A. whois 
B.dig 
C.netstat 
D.theHarvester","The correct answer is D.
 whois is used to inquire about domains, IP addresses, and other related information. dig is used to issue queries to DNS servers. netstat is used for network statistics. theHarvester, though, can be used to search across multiple sources, including Bing, Google, PGP servers, and LinkedIn."
B,B,,,,"What social networking site would be most likely to be useful in gathering information about a company, including job titles? 
A. Twitter 
B.LinkedIn 
C.Foursquare 
D.Facebook","The correct answer is B.
 While the others may include details about companies, only LinkedIn is primarily used as a business social networking site. People who have profiles there would list job titles, and job searches would indicate openings, including job titles."
A,A,,,,"You see the following text written down—port:502. What does that likely reference? 
A. Shodan search 
B.IO search 
C.p0f results 
D.RIR query","The correct answer is A.
 Shodan is a website you would use to look for IoT devices. The query language is similar to that used by Google, except it has additional keywords that could be used to identify network traffic. This may include port numbers. p0f is used for passive network traffic analysis. You might query an RIR for information about an IP address block. The domain name for Shodan is shodan.io, but there is no IO search."
D,D,,,,"What would you use Wappalyzer for? 
A. Analyzing web headers 
B.Analyzing application code 
C.Identifying web headers 
D.Identifying web technologies","The correct answer is D.
 WappAlyzer is an extension for the Chrome browser that can be used to identify technologies used in a website. It will, in part, use HTTP headers, but it doesn’t identify the headers. It’s also not used for analyzing web headers because there is more to what WappAlyzer does than that. It may look at some pieces of application code to get frameworks that are used, but it doesn’t analyze application code in the traditional sense of application code analysis."
C,C,,,,"What technique would you ideally use to get all of the hostnames associated with a domain? 
A. DNS query 
B.Zone copy 
C.Zone transfer 
D.Recursive request","The correct answer is C.
 A DNS query can be used to identify an IP address from a hostname or vice versa. You could potentially use a brute force technique to identify hostnames, though you may not get everything using that method. A recursive request is common from a caching server to get an authoritative response. The term for getting all the contents of the zone is a zone transfer."
B,B,,,,"What information would you not expect to find in the response to a whois query about an IP address? 
A. IP address block 
B.Domain association 
C.Address block owner 
D.Technical contact","The correct answer is B.
 When you run a whois query against an IP address, you will get the block the address belongs to, the owner of the block, and the technical contact. You will also get address information and possibly additional information. You will not get an association between a domain and the address block. This may be something you might infer, but it is not something that the results provide for you."
C,C,,,,"What would you be looking for with the following Google query? filetype:txt Administrator:500: 
A. Text files owned by Administrator 
B.Administrator login from file 
C.Text files including the text Administrator:500: 
D.500 administrator files with text","The correct answer is C.
 Google uses the keyword filetype: to identify filename extensions that should be searched. Administrator: is not a keyword, which means Administrator:500: is the search term that Google would use along with the filetype of txt, which would mean text files."
D,D,,,,"What command would you use to get the list of mail servers for a domain? 
A. whois mx zone=domain.com 
B.netstat zone=domain.com mx 
C.dig domain.com @mx 
D.dig mx domain.com","The correct answer is D.
 The command whois would be used to query the RIR for information about an IP address block. It could also be used to identify information about a domain. The program netstat is used for network statistics. dig can be used, but when you provide the @ parameter, it would be followed by the name server you want to query. The correct way to look for name server records is to use ns as the record type. When you are looking for mail servers, you would look for the mx record type."
B,B,,,,"What would you get from running the command dig ns domain.com? 
A. Mail exchanger records for domain.com 
B.Name server records for domain.com 
C.Caching name server for domain.com 
D.IP address for the hostname ns","The correct answer is B.
 Mail exchanger records would be identified as mx records. A name server record is identified with the tag ns. While an enterprise may have one or even several caching name servers, the caching name server wouldn’t be said to belong to the domain because it doesn’t have any domain identification associated with it."
A,A,,,,"If you wanted to locate detailed information about a person using either their name or a username you have, which website would you use? 
A. peekyou.com 
B.twitter.com 
C.intelius.com 
D.facebook.com","The correct answer is A.
 Twitter and Facebook are social networking sites. While you may be able to locate someone using a username, you may not be able to get detailed information about the user. Intelius is a person search site, and you can get detailed information there, but you can’t search by username. PeekYou is a web site that will allow you to search for people by either name or username."
C,C,,,,"If you were looking for detailed financial information on a target company, with what resource would you have the most success? 
A. LinkedIn 
B.Facebook 
C.EDGAR 
D.MORTIMER","The correct answer is C.
 LinkedIn is typically used for business networking, but there wouldn’t be much in the way of detailed financial information there. Facebook is a social networking site, commonly used by people for social interaction. EDGAR is the database that is maintained by the SEC and includes filing information from public companies. MORTIMER is a joke. Bonus points if you recognize what the joke is."
D,D,,,,"What financial filing is required for public companies and would provide you with the annual report? 
A. 10-Q 
B.11-K 
C.401(k) 
D.14-A","The correct answer is D.
 The 10-Q is a quarterly filing. The 11-K form is related to stock options for employees. The 401(k) is a retirement account. The 14-A report required by the SEC for public companies would include the annual report to shareholders."
C,C,,,,"If you were looking up information about a company in New Zealand, which RIR would you be looking in for data? 
A. AfriNIC 
B.RIPE 
C.APNIC 
D.LACNIC","The correct answer is C.
 New Zealand is located in Oceania, considered to be in the Pacific Rim. This means it falls under the Asia Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC). AfriNIC covers Africa. RIPE covers Europe, and LACNIC covers Latin America and parts of the Caribbean."
C,C,,,,"If you receive a RST packet back from a target host, what do you know about your target? 
A. The target is using UDP rather than TCP. 
B.The destination port is open on the target host. 
C.The source port in the RST message is closed. 
D.The target expects the PSH flag to be set.","The correct answer is C.
 A TCP scan sends messages to the target, expecting to get a response. With a SYN or full connect scan, the target will respond with a SYN/ACK message from an open port. With a closed port, the target will respond with a RST."
D,D,,,,"What is the difference between a SYN scan and a full connect scan? 
A. A SYN scan and a full connect scan are the same.  
B.A full connect scan sends an ACK message first. 
C.A SYN scan uses the PSH flag with the SYN flag. 
D.The SYN scan doesn’t complete the three-way handshake.","The correct answer is D.
 A SYN scan sends the first SYN message and then responds with a RST message after receiving the SYN/ACK from the target. A full connect scan completes the three-way handshake before sending the RST message. Since the full connect scan follows the correct order of the three-way handshake, it doesn’t send an ACK first. There is also no PSH flag sent with the SYN flag, since there is no data to push up the stack yet."
A,A,,,,"What is one reason a UDP scan may take longer than a TCP scan of the same host? 
A. UDP will retransmit more. 
B.UDP has more ports to scan. 
C.UDP is a slower protocol. 
D.UDP requires more messages to set up.","The correct answer is A.
 There is no defined response to a message to a UDP port. It is left entirely up to the application. Since a lack of response can mean the message never reached its recipient, the scanning system has to retransmit to closed ports. UDP is generally quicker than TCP because of a lack of overhead, it requires no messages to set up, and it has the same number of ports as TCP."
C,C,,,,"Why does an ACK scan not indicate clearly that ports are open? 
A. The scanner has to guess. 
B.ACK is not a supported flag. 
C.The target system ignores the message. 
D.ACK scans cause a lot of retransmits.","The correct answer is C.
 When a system receives an ACK message, meaning a TCP segment with the ACK flag enabled (bit position storing a 1), it assumes there is an open connection and there is data that is being acknowledged. When there is no open connection, there is nothing to respond with. The system, not having anything else to do with the ACK, discards it. The scanner won’t receive a response if the port is open. However, the scanner can’t be certain that the message hasn’t just been discarded by a firewall. As a result, it indicates that the port is either open or filtered. Either would result in no response. The scanner isn’t guessing; it is providing two alternatives but can’t be certain which it is. ACK is a supported flag in the right circumstances and ACK scans do not cause retransmits, since no response means one of two things."
A,A,,,,"What is one reason for using a scan like an ACK scan? 
A. It may get through firewalls and IDS devices. 
B.It is better supported. 
C.The code in nmap is more robust. 
D.An ACK scan is needed for scripting support.","The correct answer is A.
 Evasion is an important concept. You may spend a lot of time working on evading detection or getting blocked. Since an ACK without an open connection is aberrant, the firewall or IDS may ignore it, avoiding detection. As a result, you may be able to get ACK messages through. ACK scans are not better supported. In fact, there is really no support from the network stack for an ACK scan. The code is no more robust in nmap for an ACK scan than other scans, or at least there is no evidence of that being the case. ACK scans are not needed for scripting support."
D,D,,,,"What does nmap look at for fingerprinting an operating system? 
A. The operating system headers 
B.The application version 
C.The response from connecting to port 0 
D.The IP ID field and the initial sequence number","The correct answer is D.
 When nmap performs an operating system scan, it is looking for fingerprints of the network stack in the operating system kernel. Some of the information that nmap will look at is in the IP ID field to see what numbers are used. Similarly, it will look at the initial sequence number in TCP messages to see what numbers are used there. The application version isn’t relevant to an operating system scan, and there are no operating system headers that would be associated with network traffic. Operating system headers could be considered to be part of the source code for the operating system, but nmap wouldn’t be able to see those. Port 0 is considered an invalid port, so the response to a connection from that port is irrelevant."
B,B,,,,"What is nmap looking at when it conducts a version scan? 
A. TCP and IP headers 
B.Application banners 
C.Operating system kernel 
D.IP ID and TCP sequence number fields","The correct answer is B.
 A version scan with nmap is looking to identify versions of the services/applications running on the target. The kernel is identified with an OS scan. TCP and IP headers don’t provide application versions. The IP ID field and TCP sequence number fields don’t provide version information either."
C,C,,,,"What is an advantage of using masscan over nmap? 
A. masscan has been around longer. 
B.Nmap is hard to use. 
C.masscan can scan more addresses faster. 
D.masscan has access to scan more of the Internet.","The correct answer is C.
 The program masscan is a port scanner, like nmap. However, masscan was developed to scan the entire Internet as quickly as possible. As a result, if speed is a consideration, and especially if you are scanning large address blocks, masscan is probably better suited for that task. Both nmap and masscan have access to the same address space, and masscan uses the same command-line parameters, for the most part, as nmap, so they are similarly easy to use. nmap has also been around for considerably longer, since the 1990s, than masscan has."
B,B,,,,"If you were to see the following command run, what would you assume? hping -S -p 25 10.5.16.2 
A. Someone was trying to probe the web port of the target. 
B.Someone was trying to probe an email port on the target. 
C.Someone was trying to identify if SNMP was supported on 10.5.16.2. 
D.Someone had mistyped ping.","The correct answer is B.
 hping is a program used to send specially designed messages to a target. You use command-line parameters to tell hping what to include in the message being sent. The command hping -S -p 25 10.5.16.2 is used to have hping send SYN messages to port 25, the default SMTP port, at 10.5.16.2. It’s possible that someone mistyped ping, but those parameters aren’t used by ping programs, and since they are coherent for the action above, it makes more sense that they were trying to use hping. SNMP and web traffic both use different ports than port 25."
D,D,,,,"If you were to see that someone was using OpenVAS, followed by Nessus, what might you assume? 
A. They were trying to break into a system. 
B.They didn’t know how to use Nessus. 
C.They didn’t know how to use OpenVAS. 
D.They were trying to reduce false positives.","The correct answer is D.
 Vulnerability scanners don’t exploit vulnerabilities in order to gain access to a system. They would only exploit a vulnerability to the extent necessary to determine whether a vulnerability exists. If they didn’t know how to use Nessus or OpenVAS, they likely wouldn’t be using them. It’s possible they are looking to compare results from the two, but it’s also very likely they are trying to compare the results with the intention of reducing false positives."
A,A,,,,"What is the difference between a false positive and a false negative? 
A. A false positive indicates a finding that doesn’t exist, while a false negative doesn’t indicate a finding that does exist. 
B.A false positive indicates a finding that does exist, while a false negative doesn’t indi- cate a finding that doesn’t exist. 
C.A false positive doesn’t indicate a finding that does exist, while a false negative does indicate a finding that doesn’t exist. 
D.A false negative does indicate a finding that doesn’t exist, while a false positive doesn’t indicate a finding that does exist.","The correct answer is A.
 A false positive is when a finding is identified when it doesn’t actually exist. A false negative is when there is no finding identified but, in fact, there is a vulnerability. A true positive is when a finding is identified that is a vulnerability. A true negative is when a finding isn’t identified and there is no known vulnerability."
D,D,,,,"What would be the purpose of running a ping sweep? 
A. You want to identify responsive hosts without a port scan. 
B.You want to use something that is light on network traffic. 
C.You want to use a protocol that may be allowed through the firewall. 
D.All of the above.","The correct answer is D.
 There may be several reasons for performing a ping sweep. You likely want to identify responsive hosts on the network segment you are targeting. You may not, though, want to use a full port scan. ICMP is a lightweight protocol and there is a chance it will be allowed through the firewall, since it’s used for troubleshooting and diagnostics."
C,C,,,,"Which of these may be considered worst practice when it comes to vulnerability scans? 
A. Scanning production servers 
B.Notifying operations staff ahead of time 
C.Taking no action on the results 
D.Using limited details in your scan reports","The correct answer is C.
 You would be expected to scan production servers, since that would be where you would be most interested to find vulnerabilities. Letting operations staff know ahead of time is polite since vulnerability scans may inadvertently knock over systems that would need to be stood back up. Being paged in the middle of the night unexpectedly isn’t fun. If you know it’s coming, it makes it easier. You may have reasons to use limited details in your scan reports, including trying to reduce the disk space used or the paper used in printing the reports. Taking no action on the results of a vulnerability scan is about the worst thing you can do when it comes to vulnerability scans. It’s worse than not running them, since you could be considered liable because you know about the vulnerabilities but you aren’t doing anything about them."
B,B,,,,"Which of these may be considered an evasive technique? 
A. Scanning nonstandard ports 
B.Encoding data 
C.Using a proxy server 
D.Using nmap in blind mode","The correct answer is B.
 Scanning nonstandard ports isn’t evasive. It’s just as noisy as, and potentially more detectable than, scanning standard ports. You could use a proxy for some tasks, but all it would do would be to hide your own IP address, which isn’t evasive. You could still be blocked or detected. Nmap does not have a blind mode. When you encode data, though, you make it harder for the firewall or IDS to identify something bad that may be happening, since these devices can’t read the messages coming through."
A,A,,,,"If you were to notice operating system commands inside a DNS request while looking at a packet capture, what might you be looking at? 
A. Tunneling attack 
B.DNS amplification 
C.DNS recursion 
D.XML entity injection","The correct answer is A.
 Tunneling attacks can be used to hide one protocol inside another. They may be used to send operating system commands using a tunnel system. A DNS amplification attack is where a small DNS request results in much larger responses sent to the target. DNS recursion is used to look up information from DNS servers. An XML entity injection attack is a web-based attack and wouldn’t be found inside a DNS request."
C,C,,,,"What is an XMAS scan? 
A. TCP scan with SYN/ACK/FIN set 
B.UDP scan with FIN/PSH set 
C.TCP scan with FIN/PSH/URG set 
D.UDP scan SYN/URG/FIN set","The correct answer is C.
 The XMAS scan is a TCP scan that uses unusual flag settings in the TCP headers to attempt to evade firewalls or IDSs. The XMAS scan uses the FIN, PSH, and URG flags and is called an XMAS scan because it looks like the packet is lit up like a Christmas tree. None of the other answers match what an XMAS scan is."
B,B,,,,"What would you use MegaPing for? 
A. Running exploits 
B.Running a port scan 
C.Issuing manual web requests 
D.Crafting packets","The correct answer is B.
 MegaPing can be used to perform a lot of different functions, but crafting packets, sending manual web requests, and running exploits are not functions it supports. It can, though, run a port scan."
D,D,,,,"What would be a reason to use the Override feature in OpenVAS? 
A. You want to run a different plug-in for a vulnerability. 
B.You want to change the scanner settings. 
C.You want to use TCP rather than UDP. 
D.You want to change a severity rating on a finding.","The correct answer is D.
 Plug-ins are matched to vulnerabilities. A different plug-in would identify a different vulnerability and there is no way to change that. Scanner settings can be changed when you set up a scan. Using TCP rather than UDP is vague. If you want to change a severity rating from the one supplied by OpenVAS, you would override that rating. You may have mitigations in place or you may have investigated and found the finding to be a false positive."
C,C,,,,"What would you use credentials for in a vulnerability scanner? 
A. Better reliability in network findings 
B.Authenticating through VPNs for scans 
C.Scanning for local vulnerabilities 
D.Running an Active Directory scan","The correct answer is C.
 Credentials wouldn’t give better reliability in network findings, and vulnerability scanners don’t typically provide a way to directly authenticate through a VPN. The VPN client would be expected to be running ahead of time if the network is behind the VPN. An Active Directory scan is a vague answer, and it may not be something you can do with a vulnerability scanner. If you provide credentials, though, the scanner can authenticate against systems on the network and check for local vulnerabilities."
C,C,,,,"What is fragroute primarily used for? 
A. Altering network routes 
B.Capturing fragmented packets 
C.Fragmenting application traffic 
D.Fragmenting layer 2 and layer 3 headers","The correct answer is C.
 The program fragroute uses configuration statements to determine what should be done to packets destined for a specific host. This may include fragmenting application traffic as well as duplicating and delaying traffic. While there is a possibility of fragmenting layer 3 headers, if layer 2 headers were fragmented, there would be no way to get the message to the destination."
A,A,,,,"What is are RPCs primarily used for? 
A. Interprocess communications 
B.Interprocess semaphores 
C.Remote method invocation 
D.Process demand paging","The correct answer is A.
 Remote procedure calls are a way for processes on one system to communicate with processes on another system. This does not preclude two processes on the same system communicating, of course. Semaphores are another concept in computer science that can enable interprocess communication. Remote method invocation is a way for Java programs to implement interprocess communications. Process demand paging isn’t a thing."
C,C,,,,"What would you be trying to enumerate if you were to use enum4linux? 
A. Procedures 
B.Linux-based services 
C.Shares and/or users 
D.Memory utilization","The correct answer is C.
 enum4linux is a tool that makes use of other, underlying tools to scan systems that have implemented SMB.
 This means enum4linux can be used to enumerate shares or users, as well as other information. None of the other options are valid."
D,D,,,,"How do you authenticate with SNMPv1? 
A. Username/password 
B.Hash 
C.Public string 
D.Community string","The correct answer is D.
 SNMPv3 implemented username and password authentication. With version 1, you used a cleartext community string. SNMP doesn’t use hashes, and while the word public is often used to describe a community string, a public string is not a way to authenticate with SNMPv1."
C,C,,,,"What SMTP command would you use to get the list of users in a mailing list? 
A. EXPD 
B.VRFY 
C.EXPN 
D.VRML","The correct answer is C.
 The SMTP command used to expand a mailing list alias to get the underlying email addresses that belong to that mailing list or group is EXPN. VRFY is verify, and the other two are not valid SMTP commands."
B,B,,,,"What type of enumeration would you use the utility dirb for? 
A. Directory listings 
B.Directory enumeration 
C.Brute force dialing 
D.User directory analysis","The correct answer is B.
 The utility dirb uses a word list to attempt to enumerate directories available through a web server that may not be available by looking at all the pages and links in the site."
D,D,,,,"What are data descriptions in SNMP called? 
A. Management-based information 
B.Data structure definition 
C.Extensible markup language 
D.Management information base","The correct answer is D.
 SNMP can be used to retrieve information from remote systems. This information has to be described, including the different data types. All of the information available is described in a management information base (MIB). The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a way of packaging data in a structured way but it is not used in SNMP."
A,A,,,,"What is the process Java programs identify themselves to if they are sharing procedures over the network? 
A. RMI registry 
B.RMI mapper 
C.RMI database 
D.RMI process","The correct answer is A.
 Interprocess communications across systems using a network is called Remote Method Invocation. The process with which programs have to communicate to get a dynamic port allocation is the RMI registry. This is the program you query to identify services that are available on a system that has implemented RMI."
C,C,,,,"You are working with a colleague and you see them interacting with an email server using the VRFY command. What is it your colleague is doing? 
A. Verifying SMTP commands 
B.Verifying mailing lists 
C.Verifying email addresses 
D.Verifying the server config","The correct answer is C.
 The extended SMTP (ESMTP) protocol has a command that is abbreviated VRFY that is used to verify email addresses. A mail server may or may not have exposed this command, even if the server software supports ESMTP. Expanding mailing lists is EXPN. You wouldn’t use VRFY for a mailing list in that same sense. The other two don’t have specific commands that are specified in the SMTP protocol definition."
B,B,,,,"What is the SMB protocol used for? 
A. Data transfers using NFS 
B.Data transfers on Windows systems 
C.Data transfers for email attachments 
D.Data transfers for Windows Registry updates","The correct answer is B.
 The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is used for multiple functions on Windows networks. One of them is to transfer files (data) from one system to another. Email attachments would be transmitted using SMTP. NFS manages its own data transfer when files are being copied from one system to another. There are no data transfers specifically for Windows Registry updates."
D,D,,,,"Which of these is a built-in program on Windows for gathering information using SMB? 
A. nmblookup 
B.smbclient 
C.Metasploit 
D.nbtstat","The correct answer is D.
 The program nmblookup can be used on Linux systems. smbclient is a program that comes with a Samba installation that can be used to interact with a system using SMB.
 Metasploit has a lot of functions, but it’s not built into Windows. The program nbtstat, though, can be used to gather information using SMB, and it is a program that is installed with Windows."
A,A,,,,"What status code will you get if your attempt to use the VRFY command fails? 
A. 550 
B.501 
C.250 
D.200","The correct answer is A.
 The status code you would get if your VRFY command failed against an SMTP server is 550. 200 is the status code for success with a web server. The other codes are not valid in this context."
B,B,,,,"What program would you use to enumerate services? 
A. smbclient 
B.Nmap 
C.enum4linux 
D.snmpwalk","The correct answer is B.
 The programs smbclient and enum4linux may be used to enumerate information using SMB.
 The program snmpwalk can be used to enumerate information over SNMP. Nmap, though, can be used to enumerate services running on all the systems on a network."
D,D,,,,"What version of SNMP introduced encryption and user-based authentication? 
A. 1 
B.2 
C.2c 
D.3","The correct answer is D.
 Version 1 of SNMP used community strings. Version 2c also used community strings. Version 2 improved version 1, but it was version 3 that implemented user-based authentication as well as encryption."
A,A,,,,"Which of these could you enumerate on a WordPress site using wpscan? 
A. Plug-ins 
B.Posts 
C.Administrators 
D.Versions","The correct answer is A.
 The program wpscan can be used to enumerate themes, users, and plug-ins. It can’t be used to enumerate administrators, specifically. It also can’t be used to enumerate posts, and since there would only be a single version, you wouldn’t enumerate versions."
B,B,,,,"Which of these tools allows you to create your own enumeration function based on ports being identified as open? 
A. Metasploit 
B.Nmap 
C.Netcat 
D.nbtstat","The correct answer is B.
 Metasploit can be extended with user-created programs. However, you wouldn’t call a Metasploit module based on ports being open. Netcat doesn’t do any enumeration, and nbtstat is a Windows program that can’t be extended. Nmap can be extended with user- written scripts. An nmap script includes a port registration so nmap knows to call that script when specific ports are found to be open."
C,C,,,,"What underlying functionality is necessary to enable Windows file sharing? 
A. Network File System 
B.Common Internet File System 
C.Remote procedure call 
D.Remote Method Invocation","The correct answer is C.
 SMB relies on remote procedure calls (RPCs) in order to function. The common Internet File System (CIFS) is an implementation of file sharing and system management using SMB.
 The Network File System (NFS) is a protocol that makes use of remote procedure calls. Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is a way to call procedures remotely over Java."
D,D,,,,"What is the IPC$ share used for? 
A. Process piping 
B.Interprocess construction 
C.Remote process management 
D.Interprocess communication","The correct answer is D.
 The IPC$ share is a named pipe that enables interprocess communications over a network. While you may be able to do some remote management using the IPC$ share, it is not used for remote process management."
B,B,,,,"What tool does a Java program need to use to implement remote process communication? 
A. JRE 
B.rmic 
C.rmir 
D.JDK","The correct answer is B.
 The JRE is the Java runtime environment and is necessary to run Java programs. The JDK is the Java development kit and is necessary to develop Java programs. The program rmic is used to create RMI programs. It creates the stubs necessary for RMI to function. rmir isn’t anything."
C,C,,,,"Which of these passes objects between systems? 
A. SunRPC 
B.SMB 
C.RMI 
D.Nmap","The correct answer is C.
 RMI is a way to implement interprocess communications using Java. Since Java is an object-oriented programming language, it would transmit objects. SMB is the Server Message Block protocol. SunRPC does remote procedure calls but the data transmitted isn’t object oriented. Nmap is a program used to scan ports."
A,A,,,,"If you needed to enumerate data across multiple services and also store the data for retrieval later, what tool would you use? 
A. Metasploit 
B.Nmap 
C.RMI 
D.Postgres","The correct answer is A.
 While nmap is an excellent program in its own right and can be used to enumerate data across multiple services, it doesn’t store data for retrieval later without some additional help. Metasploit can also be used to enumerate data across multiple services and also uses a database on the backend to store data to be retrieved later. RMI is Remote Method Invocation, a way to implement interprocess communications across a network. Postgresql is the database server commonly used underneath Metasploit. Postgres is a much older version of what is now PostgreSQL."
D,D,,,,"What are the three times that are typically stored as part of file metadata? 
A. Moves, adds, changes  
B.Modified, accessed, deleted 
C.Moved, accessed, changed 
D.Modified, accessed, created","The correct answer is D.
 There are three date and time stamps commonly used in file metadata. When the file is created, that moment is stored. When a file is accessed by a user, that moment is stored. When a file is modified, that moment is stored. Accessed is not the same as modified since accessing a file could be read-only. You could open a file expecting to modify it, but not end up doing the modification. The access time still changes. While moves, adds, and changes may sometimes be referred to as MAC, like modified, accessed, and created, those are not tasks associated with file times."
A,A,,,,"What is it called when you obtain administrative privileges from a normal user account? 
A. Privilege escalation 
B.Account migration 
C.Privilege migration 
D.Account escalation","The correct answer is A.
 Account migration, privilege migration, and account escalation are vague and don’t have clearly defined definitions, even if they may exist. Privilege escalation, on the other hand, is used to gain elevated privileges when you only have the permissions of a normal user."
B,B,,,,"What does John the Ripper’s single crack mode, the default mode, do? 
A. Checks every possible password 
B.Uses known information and mangling rules 
C.Uses a built-in wordlist 
D.Uses wordlist and mangling rules","The correct answer is B.
 Incremental mode in John will run an attack in which it will try every possible password within specified parameters, meaning John will generate the passwords. The default mode in John is single crack mode, which uses information including the username and the home directory to generate a password using mangling rules. Incremental mode does not use wordlists, though John does support the use of wordlists."
D,D,,,,"What is the trade-off for using rainbow tables? 
A. Disk space prioritized over speed 
B.Accuracy prioritized over disk space 
C.Speed prioritized over accuracy 
D.Speed prioritized over disk space","The correct answer is D.
 Rainbow tables use precomputed hashes that are mapped to plaintext passwords in order to speed up the process of obtaining the passwords from stored hashes. Rainbow tables, though, are very expensive when it comes to disk space. Hashes and passwords are stored in the rainbow tables. Accuracy is neither sacrificed nor prioritized using rainbow tables. You will give up disk space to get faster cracking times using rainbow tables."
C,C,,,,"Which of these is a reason to use an exploit against a local vulnerability? 
A. Pivoting 
B.Log manipulation 
C.Privilege escalation 
D.Password collection","The correct answer is C.
 Local vulnerabilities are used against applications that are not listening on the network. This means they require you to be “local” to the machine and not remote. In other words, you have to be logged in somehow. A local vulnerability would not be used to collect passwords; you don’t need a vulnerability to do that. Similarly, you don’t need to make use of a vulnerability to manipulate logs or to pivot. Most of those would require you to have elevated permissions, though. A local vulnerability may be exploited to get you those elevated permissions."
B,B,,,,"What is it called when you manipulate the time stamps on files? 
A. Time stamping 
B.Timestomping 
C.Meta stomping 
D.Meta manipulation","The correct answer is B.
 Manipulating time stamps on files is called timestomping. It is used to set file times, which may be used to throw off investigations or identify intrusions. None of the other answers are real things."
A,A,,,,"What would an attacker use an alternate data stream on a Windows system for? 
A. Hiding files 
B.Running programs 
C.Storing PowerShell scripts 
D.Blocking files","The correct answer is A.
 Alternate data streams are a function of the New Technology File System (NTFS), created to support the resource forks of Apple’s file system in Windows NT. Since many of the utilities and programs in Windows don’t natively understand alternate data streams, they can’t make use of them and won’t show them. The file can be accessed if the user knows how to display and manipulate the alternate data streams."
A,A,,,,"Which of these techniques might be used to maintain access to a system? 
A. Run key in the Windows Registry 
B.Alternate data stream 
C..vimrc file on Linux 
D.PowerShell","The correct answer is A.
 You may use a PowerShell script to perform functions that could support persistence on a system, but the PowerShell script alone won’t be used to maintain access. Alternate data streams won’t be of any use for maintaining access, and a .vimrc file is a startup file for the Vi editor. The run key in the Windows Registry, though, could be used to put an entry in that would run a program automatically that could make sure an attacker could get access even after a reboot."
D,D,,,,"If you were looking for reliable exploits you could use against known vulnerabilities, what would you use? 
A. Tor network 
B.Meterpreter 
C.msfvenom 
D.Exploit-DB","The correct answer is D.
 While the Tor network may be used to obtain an exploit against a vulnerability, there is some question as to how reliable that exploit may be. The Tor network may contain malicious content, even in the case of source code. Meterpreter and msfvenom are elements of Metasploit that don’t have anything to do with locating vulnerabilities. Exploit-DB is a website and repository of exploits that could be searched to locate an exploit targeting specific and known vulnerabilities."
C,C,,,,"What might an attacker be trying to do by using the clearev command in Meterpreter? 
A. Run an exploit 
B.Manipulate time stamps 
C.Manipulate log files 
D.Remote login","The correct answer is C.
 The clearev command is a Meterpreter command used to clear the Windows Event Viewer logs. While you may be able to manipulate time stamps and log files in Meterpreter, you wouldn’t use the clearev command for that. The clearev command does not allow an attacker to log in remotely."
B,B,,,,"You find after you get access to a system that you are the user www-data. What might you try to do very shortly after getting access to the system? 
A. Pivot to another network 
B.Elevate privileges 
C.Wipe logs 
D.Exploit the web browser","The correct answer is B.
 When the Apache web server runs on a Linux system, it will commonly run as the user www-data. This is a privilege-restricted account that would prevent an attacker from doing much on the system. In order to do anything, like wiping log files or pivoting to another network, you would need to elevate privileges to administrative/root level. Exploiting the web browser wouldn’t be done in this context. A web server more than likely wouldn’t even have a web browser installed."
C,C,,,,"You’ve installed multiple files and processes on the compromised system. What should you also look at installing? 
A. Registry keys 
B.Alternate data streams 
C.Rootkit 
D.Root login","The correct answer is C.
 Attackers often install extra files and run extra processes on systems. These could easily be detected by manual investigation or, certainly, by automated detection tools. The way around that is to install a rootkit, which may include kernel-mode drivers or replacement system utilities that would hide the existence of these files and processes. Alternate data streams may be used to hide files but not processes. Registry keys could also hide files but not processes."
B,B,,,,"What does pivoting on a compromised system get you? 
A. Database access 
B.A route to extra networks 
C.Higher level of privileges 
D.Persistent access","The correct answer is B.
 Pivoting is the process of using a compromised system to move onto other systems and networks within the target environment. Pivoting does not get you higher-level permissions or persistent access. You may ultimately get to a database server by pivoting, but that’s not what pivoting does or is specifically used for. It would be a nice side effect of pivoting."
B,B,,,,"What would you use the program rtgen for? 
A. Generating wordlists 
B.Generating rainbow tables 
C.Generating firewall rules 
D.Persistent access","The correct answer is B.
 The program rtgen is a program that is part of the rcrack suite. rcrack is used to crack passwords with rainbow tables. It is used to generate the rainbow tables that rcrack will use to crack passwords. Rainbow tables are not wordlists but mappings of plaintext passwords to hashes, which makes it much easier to get passwords from hashes."
C,C,,,,"Which of these would be a way to exploit a client-side vulnerability? 
A. Sending malformed packets to a web server 
B.Sending large ICMP packets 
C.Sending a crafted URL 
D.Brute-force password attack","The correct answer is C.
 Malformed packets could potentially cause a failure or trigger a vulnerability on the server side. Large ICMP packets aren’t likely to do anything and certainly wouldn’t exploit a client-side vulnerability. A brute-force password attack isn’t exploiting a vulnerability, even if it is an attack technique. Sending a crafted URL could potentially exploit a client- side vulnerability in a web browser."
A,A,,,,"What is one outcome from process injection? 
A. Hidden process 
B.Rootkit 
C.Alternate data streams 
D.Steganography","The correct answer is A.
 Steganography is the process of hiding data inside of other data, such as media files like MP3s, WAVs, or video files. An alternate data stream is a secondary data stream attached to a filename in the NT file system. A rootkit can be used to hide processes. It may use process injection but wouldn’t be the outcome from process injection. When you inject into a process, you are putting executable operations you have created into the space of another executable. The end result could be an execution thread running your code without any new process name indicating it was running."
D,D,,,,"What tool would you use to compromise a system and then perform post-exploitation actions? 
A. Nmap 
B.John the Ripper 
C.searchsploit 
D.Metasploit","The correct answer is D.
 John the Ripper is used for cracking passwords, while nmap is used for port scanning. They could be part of the overall process of system compromise, but neither could be used to compromise a system, in spite of what it suggests in The Matrix. searchsploit is a program used to search a local exploit-db repository. Metasploit is an exploit framework that could be used to compromise a system. Once the system is compromised, Metasploit could then be used for post-exploitation actions using modules that come with it."
B,B,,,,"What application would be a common target for client-side exploits? 
A. Web server 
B.Web browser 
C.Web application firewall 
D.Web pages","The correct answer is B.
 Of all of the options presented, only the web browser exists on the client side. By definition, the web server is on the server. A web application firewall is placed with the server to protect the server from Application layer attacks. Web pages are hosted on a web server. They are not a target for client-side exploits, though they would be used to carry out those attacks."
C,C,,,,"What are two advantages of using a rootkit? 
A. Installing alternate data streams and Registry keys 
B.Creating Registry keys and hidden processes 
C.Hiding processes and files 
D.Hiding files and Registry keys","The correct answer is C.
 A rootkit is a piece of malicious software that is used to accomplish several tasks. This may include hiding processes and files through the use of kernel-mode drivers or replaced system utilities. A rootkit may also provide a backdoor for attackers to maintain long-term access to the system after the initial compromise. None of the other answers are things that a rootkit does."
B,B,,,,"What could you use to obtain password hashes from a compromised system? 
A. John the Ripper 
B.Mimikatz 
C.Rainbow tables 
D.Process dumping","The correct answer is B.
 John the Ripper and Rainbow tables are tools for cracking passwords, not gathering or obtaining password hashes. Process dumping could possibly yield passwords associated with a certain process/application. However, you may not get password hashes, depending on how the passwords are maintained in memory. Process dumping is taking the memory space of a process and writing it out to disk for analysis. Mimikatz is a utility and Metasploit module that could be used to extract passwords from a compromised system."
A,A,,,,"In a botnet, what are the systems that tell individual bots what to do called? 
A. C2 servers 
B.IRC servers 
C.HTTP servers 
D.ISC2 servers","The correct answer is A.
 C2 servers are command and control servers. These are servers that can be used to provide management and control of bots in a botnet. The communication may be IRC or HTTP, but not necessarily. The servers aren’t called that in a botnet anyway. ISC2 servers don’t exist."
C,C,,,,"What is the primary difference between a worm and a virus? 
A. A worm uses polymorphic code. 
B.A virus uses polymorphic code. 
C.A worm can self-propagate. 
D.A virus can self-propagate.","The correct answer is C.
 Both worms and viruses could be written to use polymorphic code, which means they could modify what they look like as they propagate. A worm, though, could self-propagate. It’s the one distinction between worms and viruses. Viruses require some intervention on the part of the user to propagate and execute."
C,C,,,,"What is one advantage of static analysis over dynamic analysis of malware? 
A. Malware is guaranteed to deploy. 
B.Dynamic analysis is untrustworthy. 
C.Static analysis limits your exposure to infection. 
D.Static analysis can be run in virtual machines.","The correct answer is C.
 Static analysis is looking at the properties of the executable file and evaluating the assembly language code without running the program. This will limit your exposure to infection, because if you do it right you aren’t running the program, which would infect you. Dynamic analysis is trustworthy, and malware can’t deploy if you don’t run it. Dynamic analysis is commonly done in virtual machines."
D,D,,,,"What would you use VirusTotal for? 
A. Checking your system for viruses 
B.Endpoint protection 
C.As a repository of malware research 
D.Identifying malware against antivirus engines","The correct answer is D.
 VirusTotal takes dozens of antivirus engines and runs samples through them to identify what malware they might be. VirusTotal is a website, which means it can’t check your system for viruses and also can’t do any endpoint protection. While VirusTotal can identify the name given to a malware sample by different antivirus solutions, to find the research associated with that malware, you would need to check with the antivirus vendor."
D,D,,,,"What are two sections you would commonly find in a portable executable file? 
A. Text and binary 
B.Binary and data 
C.Addresses and operations 
D.Text and data","The correct answer is D.
 PE files have multiple sections that you may find in an executable. Two that are very common, though, are .text and .data. The .text section includes all the executable code. The .data section includes all the predefined and initialized variables. The other sections listed in other answers aren’t sections of a PE file."
B,B,,,,"What could you use to generate your own malware? 
A. Empire 
B.Metasploit 
C.Rcconsole 
D.IDA Pro","The correct answer is B.
 Metasploit can be used to generate your own malware from one of the payload modules. Empire is another exploitation framework built around PowerShell. IDA Pro is a debugger and Rcconsole doesn’t exist."
A,A,,,,"What is the purpose of a packer for malware? 
A. To obscure the actual program 
B.To ensure that the program is all binary 
C.To compile the program into a tight space 
D.To remove null characters","The correct answer is A.
 All programs that have been compiled are in binary. Even scripting languages are in binary by the time they hit the processor. Packers will make a program smaller, which was initially of some value when bandwidth wasn’t as ubiquitous, but a packer doesn’t do any compilation. A packer does not remove null characters. A packer can, however, obscure the actual program code because the only executable function is one designed to extract and decompress the real malware."
C,C,,,,"What is the primary purpose of polymorphic code for malware programs? 
A. Efficiency of execution 
B.Propagation of the malware 
C.Antivirus evasion 
D.Faster compilation","The correct answer is C.
 Polymorphic means many bodies, which means it has multiple looks. When a program has multiple looks, it can cause antivirus programs to misidentify it. Polymorphic code rewrites the program when it is copied or moved from one system or location to another. It isn’t more efficient and doesn’t help with propagation, though it could be part of the propagation process. It also doesn’t speed compilation."
B,B,,,,"What would be one reason not to write malware in Python? 
A. Python interpreter is slow. 
B.Python interpreter may not be available. 
C.Library support is inadequate. 
D.Python is a hard language to learn.","The correct answer is B.
 Python interpreters may be considered slower to execute than a compiled program, but the difference is negligible and speed of execution generally isn’t much of a concern when it comes to malware. Python is not a hard language to learn, and there are a lot of community-developed libraries. One challenge, though, is that you may need a Python interpreter unless you go through the step of getting a Python compiler and compiling your script. Windows systems wouldn’t commonly have a Python interpreter installed."
C,C,,,,"What would you use Cuckoo Sandbox for? 
A. Static analysis of malware 
B.Malware development 
C.Dynamic analysis of malware 
D.Manual analysis of malware","The correct answer is C.
 Cuckoo Sandbox is a set of programs and infrastructure used to run malware and identify changes to the system that result. This means it is used for dynamic analysis of malware, not for static analysis. Because it’s automated, it’s not manual. Also, it’s used for analysis, not development."
B,B,,,,"If you wanted a tool that could help with both static and dynamic analysis of malware, which would you choose? 
A. Cutter 
B.IDA 
C.PE Explorer 
D.MalAlyzer","The correct answer is B.
 You need a tool that can perform disassembly if you are doing static analysis. Dynamic analysis can make use of disassembled executables, but the tool would need to also be able to execute the code. IDA is the only tool there that does both disassembly and execution. Cutter only does disassembly. PE Explorer does neither, and MalAlyzer doesn’t exist."
A,A,,,,"What is the purpose of using a disassembler? 
A. Converting opcodes to mnemonics 
B.Converting mnemonics to opcodes 
C.Translating mnemonics to operations 
D.Removing the need for an assembler","The correct answer is A.
 An executable contains a set of binary values that the CPU will interpret as operation codes (opcodes) when the program is run. These binary values won’t generally mean much to people when they are bare. As a result, disassemblers are used to convert opcodes to mnemonics, which are short/abbreviated words that can let someone know what the opcode does."
C,C,,,,"What does the malware that is referred to as a dropper do? 
A. Drops antivirus operations 
B.Drops CPU protections against malicious execution 
C.Drops files that may be more malware 
D.Drops the malware into the Recycle Bin","The correct answer is C.
 A dropper downloads (drops) additional files, which may be malware. It doesn’t do any of the things mentioned in the other options."
B,B,,,,"Why would you use an encoder when you are creating malware using Metasploit? 
A. To compile the malware 
B.To evade antivirus 
C.To evade user detection 
D.To compress the malware","The correct answer is B.
 An encoder is used to alter the look of an executable file. This alteration is done in order to prevent the antivirus program from recognizing the executable as malware. It doesn’t compile the malware and doesn’t evade user detection. A packer would be used to compress malware."
B,B,,,,"If you were to see the following command in someone’s history, what would you think had happened? msfvenom -i 5 -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -o program 
A. A poison pill was created. 
B.A malicious program was generated. 
C.Existing malware was encoded. 
D.Metasploit was started.","The correct answer is B.
 The program msfvenom is used to convert a payload module from Metasploit into an executable program. The malware could potentially be used as part of a poison pill, which is a type of defensive tactic, but it’s hard to determine that just from the command line. While the malware is encoded as part of this process, it is not an existing piece of malware. This is not a way to start Metasploit, though msfvenom does make use of the Metasploit framework."
A,A,,,,"What is the difference between a virus and ransomware? 
A. Ransomware may be a virus. 
B.Ransomware includes Bitcoins. 
C.Ransomware is only generated in Russia. 
D.A virus only runs on Windows systems.","The correct answer is A.
 This is a bit of a trick question. Ransomware may be a virus, which means it is a subset of the category virus. Ransomware may ask to be paid in Bitcoins, but it doesn’t include Bitcoins. Ransomware has been generated all over the world and viruses run on all operating systems."
C,C,,,,"Why would someone use a Trojan? 
A. It acts as malware infrastructure. 
B.It evades antivirus. 
C.It pretends to be something else. 
D.It’s polymorphic.","The correct answer is C.
 A Trojan, also called a Trojan horse, appears to be one thing but is, in fact, another. It can fool users into running the malware because they are expecting something else. A Trojan can’t evade antivirus if there is a signature that matches the executable. It doesn’t act as malware infrastructure, and while it may be polymorphic, that wouldn’t be why someone used a Trojan."
B,B,,,,"Which of these tools would be most beneficial when trying to dynamically analyze malware? 
A. Cutter 
B.OllyDbg 
C.Metasploit 
D.AV-Test","The correct answer is B.
 When you are trying to dynamically analyze malware, a debugger is useful because it allows you to run the malware and also control its execution. OllyDbg is the only debugger in that list. Cutter does disassembly but does not allow you to run the malware and control its execution."
Client,Client,,,,Which end of a client/server communication goes on the infected system if it is communi- cating with infrastructure?,"The correct answer is Client. The malware would act as a client. The client is the end of the conversation that initiates the communication. It’s better to initiate from inside the network to get through firewalls, which may block inbound communication flows."
D,D,,,,"Which of these would be a reason why it is best for communications to originate from inside the infected network? 
A. Antivirus 
B.Virtual machines 
C.Intrusion detection 
D.Firewall","The correct answer is D.
 The firewall may block inbound communications, which is why it’s better for the communication to originate from the inside. Either direction could be caught by intrusion detection. Virtual machines don’t factor in here, and antivirus could catch the malware regardless of which direction the traffic is going, since antivirus uses the executable file rather than the communication stream for detection."
C,C,,,,"Which hardware vendor uses the term SPAN on switches? 
A. HP 
B.3COM 
C.Cisco 
D.Juniper","The correct answer is C.
 Different vendors use different terms to refer to port mirroring. Cisco uses the term Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN), which leads to the process sometimes being called port spanning."
B,B,,,,"If you saw the following command line, what would you be capturing? tcpdump -i eth2 host 192.168.10.5 
A. Traffic just from 192.168.10.5 
B.Traffic to and from 192.168.10.5 
C.Traffic just to 192.168.10.5 
D.All traffic other than from 192.168.86.5","The correct answer is B.
 The expression host 192.168.10.5 is BPF, indicating that tcpdump should only capture packets to and from 192.168.10.5. If you wanted to only get it to or from, you would need to modify host with src or dest."
D,D,,,,"In the following packet, what port is the source port? 20:45:55.272087 IP yazpistachio.lan.62882 > loft.lan.afs3-fileserver: Flags [P.], seq 915235445:915235528, ack 3437317287, win 2048, options [nop,nop,TS val 1310611430 ecr 1794010423], length 83 
A. lan 
B.fileserver 
C.yazpistachio 
D.62882","The correct answer is D.
 tcpdump uses the format hostname/IP.port when it prints an address. The addresses go source > destination, so yazpistachio.lan is the hostname and 62882 is the port on the source address."
A,A,,,,"What is one downside to running a default tcpdump without any parameters? 
A. DNS requests 
B.Not enough information 
C.Sequence numbers don’t show 
D.tcpdump won’t run without additional parameters","The correct answer is A.
 By default, tcpdump does name resolution. Not only does tcpdump look up port numbers and print their service names, it also triggers a DNS lookup. This DNS lookup is network traffic, which means that for most packets there is probably a DNS lookup request showing in the packet capture."
C,C,,,,"At which protocol layer does the Berkeley Packet Filter operate? 
A. Internetwork 
B.Transport 
C.Data Link 
D.Protocol","The correct answer is C.
 BPF operates at the Data Link layer. This allows filtering down to the MAC address. If BPF operated at other layers, you wouldn’t get the entire set of packet headers."
C,C,,,,"What do we call an ARP response without a corresponding ARP request? 
A. Is-at response 
B. Who-has ARP 
C.Gratuitous ARP 
D.IP response","The correct answer is C.
 When an ARP response is sent without a corresponding ARP request, it’s an unexpected or unnecessary message. This makes it a gratuitous ARP."
C,C,,,,"Which functionality in Wireshark will provide you with percentages for every protocol in the packet capture, ordered by protocol layers? 
A. Conversations 
B.Endpoints 
C.Protocol hierarchy 
D.Statistics view","The correct answer is C.
 While conversations and endpoints are statistics you can get from Wireshark, the protocol hierarchy view shows a layered look at all the protocols in the capture, showing percentages for all of the protocols."
D,D,,,,"Which program would you use if you wanted to only print specific fields from the captured packet? 
A. fielddump 
B.tcpdump 
C.wiredump 
D.tshark","The correct answer is D.
 While tcpdump and tshark can both be used to capture packets, tshark gives you the ability to specify which fields you want to output. The other two options don’t exist."
C,C,,,,"The following shows a time stamp. What does the time of this message reflect? 630 41.897644 192.168.86.210 239.255.255.250 SSDP 750 NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1 [ETHERNET FRAME CHECK SEQUENCE INCORRECT] 
A. The time since 1970 
B.The time of day 
C.The time since packet start 
D.There is no time in the summary","The correct answer is C.
 By default, Wireshark shows a relative time since the start of the packet capture. You can change the field to show absolute time, such as the time of day or the time since 1970 (epoch time). However, that’s not what is shown."
D,D,,,,"What protocol is being used in the frame listed in this summary? 719 42.691135 157.240.19.26 192.168.86.26 TCP 1464 → 61618 [ACK] Seq=4361 Ack=1276 Win=31232 Len=1398 TSval=3725556941 TSecr=1266252437 [TCP segment of a reassembled PDU] 443 
A. TLS 
B.UDP 
C.IP 
D.TCP","The correct answer is D.
 After the frame number, time, source IP, and destination IP is the protocol. This frame shows TCP is the protocol in use."
C,C,,,,"What program could be used to perform spoofing attacks and also supports plug-ins? 
A. arpspoof 
B.fragroute 
C.Ettercap 
D.sslstrip","The correct answer is C.
 arpspoof and Ettercap can both be used to perform ARP spoofing. Ettercap also supports other types of spoofing attacks and plug-ins. Sslstrip is a plug-in supported in Ettercap. Fragroute is a program that does something completely different."
C,C,,,,"What would you need to do before you could perform a DNS spoof attack? 
A. Set up a port span 
B.Start up Wireshark 
C.ARP spoof 
D.Configure sslstrip","The correct answer is C.
 A DNS spoofing attack requires that the program can see the DNS request in order to respond to it. This means there needs to be an ARP spoof in place so Ettercap (or another tool) can get the traffic on the network to get the DNS request to respond to."
A,A,,,,"Which command-line parameter would you use to disable name resolutions in tcpdump? 
A. -n 
B.-i 
C.-r 
D.-x","The correct answer is A.
 The -i flag indicates which interface you are going to listen on. The -n flag tells Wireshark to not do name resolution, leaving you with numeric values for the IP address and port number."
B,B,,,,"Why might you have more endpoints shown at layer 4 than at layer 2? 
A. Layer 4 multiplexes layer 2. 
B.Systems may initiate multiple connections to the same host. 
C.Ports are more numerous than MAC addresses. 
D.The IP addresses dictate the endpoints.","The correct answer is B.
 The number of MAC addresses can be smaller than the number of layer 3 addresses because multiple IP addresses could be associated with a single MAC address if the IP addresses are off network; the MAC address for those would be the gateway’s MAC address. If a system opens multiple connections to the same system, as may happen when rendering a web page, there would be multiple port combinations for the same IP source and destination."
A,A,,,,"What would you use sslstrip for? 
A. Getting plaintext traffic 
B.Removing all SSL requests 
C.Converting SSL to TLS 
D.Converting TLS to SSL","The correct answer is A.
 Sslstrip is used to get plaintext traffic. It does not remove SSL requests, though it may be used to convert an HTTPS request to an HTTP request. It does not convert SSL to TLS or TLS to SSL, and there would be no particular advantage to either of those tasks."
B,B,,,,"Why might you have problems with sslstrip? 
A. sslstrip is deprecated. 
B.sslstrip doesn’t work with newer versions of TLS. 
C.sslstrip doesn’t support TLS. 
D.sslstrip only works with Ettercap.","The correct answer is B.
 Sslstrip was released in 2009 and took advantage of problems in SSL. These problems not only existed in SSL but also continued through early versions of TLS. Newer versions of TLS don’t have the same issues, which means sslstrip won’t work with them."
A,A,,,,"What does the following line mean? Sequence number: 4361 (relative sequence number) 
A. The sequence number shown is not the real sequence number. 
B.The sequence number shown has not been incremented. 
C.The sequence number shown isn’t long enough. 
D.The sequence number shown is the acknowledgment number.","The correct answer is A.
 Wireshark presents a relative sequence number, which means the initial sequence number as far as Wireshark is concerned in presenting it to you is 1. The relative sequence number increments just as the real sequence number does. The real sequence number, which is a very large value, is hidden to make analysis easier."
B,B,,,,"What can you say about [TCP Segment Len: 35], as provided by Wireshark? 
A. The window size has changed. 
B.Wireshark has inferred this information. 
C.Wireshark extracted this from one of the headers. 
D.Wireshark has additional detail below.","The correct answer is B.
 Anything you see in Wireshark that is in square brackets [] is something Wireshark has calculated or inferred. It is not something that has been extracted directly from the packet capture. Wireshark is helping with the packet analysis."
C,C,,,,"What problem does port spanning overcome? 
A. Switches don’t support layer 3. 
B.Switches aggregate ports. 
C.Switches filter traffic. 
D.Switches are unreliable.","The correct answer is C.
 Switches filter traffic by only sending traffic destined for the MAC address associated with the port to which the system that owns the MAC address is attached. Switches are reliable. They don’t support layer 3 as switches, though there are such things as multilayer switches that include routing functionality. Either way, that’s not something that port spanning overcomes. Switches may aggregate ports, but port spanning doesn’t have anything to do with that."
B,B,,,,"What is the /etc/ettercap/etter.dns file used for? 
A. Enabling firewall rules for Ettercap 
B.Configuring hostnames to IP addresses 
C.Setting up mail for Ettercap 
D.Disabling ARP spoofing in Ettercap","The correct answer is B.
 The ipchains/iptables command to turn on redirection for Ettercap is done in a different file. In the etter.dns file is the mapping of hostnames to IP addresses as well as other DNS resource records."
A,A,,,,"You get a phone call from someone telling you they are from the IRS and they are sending the police to your house now to arrest you unless you provide a method of payment imme- diately. What tactic is the caller using? 
A. Pretexting 
B.Biometrics 
C.Smishing 
D.Rogue access","The correct answer is A.
 Biometrics is the use of a physical attribute to provide authentication. Smishing is using short message service (SMS/texting) to gather information from people. Rogue access isn’t really anything. Pretexting is coming up with a believable story that you can use when trying to perform a social engineering attack on someone."
C,C,,,,"You are working on a red-team engagement. Your team leader has asked you to use baiting as a way to get in. What are you being asked to do? 
A. Make phone calls 
B.Clone a website 
C.Leave USB sticks around 
D.Spoof an RFID ID","The correct answer is C.
 Baiting is leaving a lure out in order to gather targets. You could use USB sticks or CDs around as bait if they had software on them that would run and “infect” the target system in a way that would give you control over them. While all of the other options are related to social engineering, none of them is called baiting."
B,B,,,,"Which of the social engineering principles is in use when you see a line of people at a ven- dor booth at a security conference waiting to grab free USB sticks and CDs? 
A. Reciprocity 
B.Social proof 
C.Authority 
D.Scarcity","The correct answer is B.
 Social proof is in use when it appears to be okay to engage in a behavior because you see others engaging in it. When people see a line of others waiting to grab USB sticks, in spite of knowing they shouldn’t trust USB sticks, they may be inclined to lower their defenses. There is no reciprocity or authority here. There may eventually be scarcity, but that’s not what would drive people to stand in line to acquire a potentially dangerous item."
D,D,,,,"What is a viable approach to protecting against tailgaiting? 
A. Biometrics 
B.Badge access 
C.Phone verification 
D.Man traps","The correct answer is D.
 Biometrics and badge access are forms of physical access control. Phone verification could possibly be used as a way of verifying identity, but it won’t protect against tailgating. A man trap, however, will protect against tailgating because a man trap allows only one person in at a time."
B,B,,,,"Why would you use wireless social engineering? 
A. To send phishing messages 
B.To gather credentials 
C.To get email addresses 
D.To make phone calls","The correct answer is B.
 Especially in enterprises, there is generally some authentication that happens. This could be in the form of a pre-shared key or a username/password combination. Either way, when you are using social engineering of wireless networks, you are probably attempting to gather credentials to gain access to sites. It’s unlikely you’d use this vector for sending phishing messages or getting email addresses, and it wouldn’t be used to make phone calls."
D,D,,,,"Which social engineering principle may allow a phony call from the help desk to be effective? 
A. Social proof 
B.Imitation 
C.Scarcity 
D.Authority","The correct answer is D.
 While you might be imitating someone, imitation is not a social engineering principle. Neither social proof nor scarcity are at play in this situation. However, if you are calling from the help desk, you may be considered to be in a position of authority."
B,B,,,,"Why would you use automated tools for social engineering attacks? 
A. Better control over outcomes 
B.Reduce complexity 
C.Implement social proof 
D.Demonstrate authority","The correct answer is B.
 It’s debatable whether you get better control over outcomes executing your attacks manually. You would not be implementing social proof or demonstrating authority using an automated attack any more than if you did it manually. You would be reducing complexity, though, since doing it manually means you would be setting up and controlling multiple moving pieces. This gets to be complex, and the attack would fail if you didn’t get it just right."
A,A,,,,"What social engineering vector would you use if you wanted to gain access to a building? 
A. Impersonation 
B.Scarcity 
C.Vishing 
D.Smishing","The correct answer is A.
 Vishing and smishing are non-kinetic approaches to social engineering. Scarcity is not a social engineering vector. Impersonation is a social engineering vector and the one used to gain unauthorized access to a facility."
C,C,,,,"Which of these would be an example of pretexting? 
A. Web page asking for credentials 
B.A cloned badge 
C.An email from a former co-worker 
D.Rogue wireless access point","The correct answer is C.
 If you sent an email posing as a former co-worker, you could be implementing a couple of different social engineering principles. Because you have a story and a means to collect information fraudulently, you are using pretexting. The other attacks are also social engineering, but they are not pretexting."
C,C,,,,"What tool could you use to clone a website? 
A. httclone 
B.curl-get 
C.wget 
D.wclone","The correct answer is C.
 wget is the only one of these options that is a legitimate program, and it can be used to clone a website."
B,B,,,,"How would someone keep a baiting attack from being successful? 
A. Disable Registry cloning. 
B.Disable autorun. 
C.Epoxy external ports. 
D.Don’t browse the Internet.","The correct answer is B.
 While some people do epoxy USB ports to prevent USB sticks from being inserted, it’s not a good approach and wouldn’t necessarily keep a baiting attack from working if the bait is a CD-ROM. Browsing the Internet is common and no longer doing that won’t protect you against baiting. Registry cloning isn’t really a thing in this context. Disabling autorun would keep any malicious software from running automatically from external devices."
D,D,,,,"What statistic are you more likely to be concerned about when thinking about implement- ing biometrics? 
A. False positive rate 
B.False negative rate 
C.False failure rate 
D.False acceptance rate","The correct answer is D.
 A false acceptance rate measures how often a biometric system allows unauthorized users access to a facility or area. A false failure (or reject) rate is inconvenient, and some organizations may consider that to be an issue, especially if it’s very high. However, a high false accept rate is probably more concerning because you are allowing people who are really unauthorized to have access. The other two are not statistics that are measured; though they correlate to the others, they are not called false positive rate or false negative rate."
A,A,,,,"Which of these forms of biometrics is least likely to give a high true accept rate while mini- mizing false reject rates? 
A. Voiceprint 
B.Iris scanning 
C.Retinal scanning 
D.Fingerprint scanning","The correct answer is A.
 Voiceprint identification is the least reliable of these options. As a result, it would be the most likely to give you a high false reject rate, which would lower the true accept rate."
D,D,,,,"What attack can a proximity card be susceptible to? 
A. Tailgating 
B.Phishing 
C.Credential theft 
D.Cloning","The correct answer is D.
 A proximity card could enable tailgating, but it’s not the only thing—a key could enable tailgating as well. Technically, it’s not the card that allows tailgating anyway. It’s the way the doors are configured and implemented. Phishing is unrelated, and technically, credential theft is as well. Proximity cards, particularly if they use RFID tags, are susceptible to cloning."
C,C,,,,"Which form of biometrics scans a pattern in the area of the eye around the pupil? 
A. Retinal scanning 
B.Fingerprint scanning 
C.Iris scanning 
D.Uvea scanning","The correct answer is C.
 While the retina and the uvea are also parts of the eye, neither of them encloses the pupil and can be used as a means of identification. Fingerprints are not part of the eye."
A,A,,,,"What would the result of a high false failure rate be? 
A. People having to call security 
B.Unauthorized people being allowed in 
C.Forcing the use of a man trap 
D.Reduction in the use of biometrics","The correct answer is A.
 A false acceptance rate would be allowing unauthorized people in. If you are an authorized person but your biometric scanner isn’t working reliably and rejects you, you may need to call security or someone else to let you into the building. Neither of the other two would be a result of a high false failure rate. They may be solutions to other problems, but not a high false failure rate."
B,B,,,,"You’ve received a text message from an unknown number that is only five digits long. It doesn’t have any text, just a URL. What might this be an example of? 
A. Vishing 
B.Smishing 
C.Phishing 
D.Impersonation","The correct answer is B.
 Smishing is short message phishing, which means someone is sending a text message, attempting to fraudulently gather information. Vishing is a phone call (voice). Phishing can be an overall term but commonly refers to email. Impersonation is more of a physical approach."
A,A,,,,"What is an advantage of a phone call over a phishing email? 
A. You are able to go into more detail with pretexting. 
B.Phishing attacks are unreliable. 
C.Not everyone has email but everyone has a phone. 
D.Pretexting only works over the phone.","The correct answer is A.
 Pretexting can work over email just as well as via a phone call. It may be more common for people to have email than a phone, especially a company-owned landline. Phishing attacks are very successful, which is why they are so commonly used. With a phone call, though, you could go into more detail and address questions or concerns as they arise. You could include additional layers that you couldn’t with an email since you could never be sure if your email was read, or deleted, or caught in a filter."
B,B,,,,"What is the web page you may be presented with when connecting to a wireless access point, especially in a public place? 
A. Credential harvester 
B.Captive portal 
C.Wi-Fi portal 
D.Authentication point","The correct answer is B.
 The captive portal is the page that is opened when you connect to a public access point. None of the other answers are real things."
C,C,,,,"What tool could you use to generate email attacks as well as wireless attacks? 
A. Meterpreter 
B.wifiphisher 
C.SE Toolkit 
D.Social Automator","The correct answer is C.
 You may end up with a Meterpreter interface to a remote system, but it wouldn’t be used to generate the attacks. wifiphisher is only used for Wi-Fi–based attacks and Social Automator doesn’t exist. The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SE Toolkit) could be used to automate email attacks as well as wireless attacks."
D,D,,,,"What are the two types of wireless networks? 
A. Star and ring 
B.Bus and hybrid 
C.Infrastructure and hybrid 
D.Infrastructure and ad hoc","The correct answer is D.
 An infrastructure wireless network is one that uses an access point. An ad hoc wireless network is one organized by the participants. These are the two types of wireless networks. Star, ring, bus, and hybrid are all wired topologies."
B,B,,,,"How many stages are used in the WPA handshake? 
A. Two 
B.Four 
C.Three 
D.One","The correct answer is B.
 There are four stages used in a WPA handshake. This four-stage process is used to derive the key and agree on capabilities."
B,B,,,,"What mode has to be enabled on a network interface to allow all headers in wireless traffic to be captured? 
A. Promiscuous 
B.Monitor 
C.Radio 
D.Wireless LAN","The correct answer is B.
 Promiscuous mode is used on network interfaces to collect frames that are not destined for the network interface. This is insufficient on a wireless network because the radio headers are not captured. To capture radio headers, monitor mode needs to be enabled in addition to the promiscuous mode that will always be set to get all frames and all information from the frame. Only monitor mode gives the radio headers."
C,C,,,,"What wireless attack would you use to take a known piece of information in order to be able to decrypt wireless traffic? 
A. Sniffing 
B.Deauthentication 
C.Key reinstallation 
D.Evil twin","The correct answer is C.
 Sniffing can be used to collect information that may be needed to launch wireless attacks. A deauthentication attack can be used to force a station to generate traffic. An evil twin attack uses a rogue access point to pretend to be a legitimate network. In order to decrypt network traffic, you would need the key. One way to get the key is to reuse information from network traffic that generated a known key. This is a key reinstallation attack."
C,C,,,,"What is the purpose of performing a Bluetooth scan? 
A. Identifying open ports 
B.Identifying available profiles 
C.Identifying endpoints 
D.Identifying vendors","The correct answer is C.
 Bluetooth doesn’t use ports. While profiles are important, you get the profile capabilities during the pairing process. Just performing a scan won’t get you a list of supported profiles. While you should be able to identify vendors as part of the process of running a Bluetooth scan, it’s not the purpose of the scan. The purpose is to identify endpoints and their associated addresses so you can run other attacks on them."
B,B,,,,"What is the purpose of a deauthentication attack? 
A. Disabling stations 
B.Forcing stations to reauthenticate 
C.Reducing the number of steps in the handshake 
D.Downgrading encryption","The correct answer is B.
 The purpose of a deauthentication attack is to force stations to reauthenticate. This allows the attacker to collect information from the authentication and handshake. This information could be used later to potentially derive the key, as in WEP transmissions. A deauthentication attack doesn’t disable stations. There is no way to reduce the number of steps in a handshake, and downgrading encryption is considerably harder, if it’s possible at all."
A,A,,,,"What is the policy that allows people to use their own smartphones on the enterprise network? 
A. Bring your own device 
B.Use your own device 
C.Bring your own smart device 
D.Use your own smart device","The correct answer is A.
 Bring your own device (BYOD) is a policy that allows employees to use their own devices on an enterprise network. This opens the door to the potential for attacks from unknown and unexpected devices. None of the other answers are real things."
C,C,,,,"What part of the encryption process was weak in WEP? 
A. Keying 
B.Diffie-Hellman 
C.Initialization vector 
D.Seeding vector","The correct answer is C.
 The initialization vector is a random value that seeds the key used for encryption and decryption. In WEP, the algorithm specified for the initialization vector yielded non- random, predictable values. While the initialization vector is part of keying, it’s not the keying itself that was weak. Seeding vector is not a real thing, and Diffie-Hellman is a process used to derive and exchange keys securely. It’s not part of WEP."
B,B,,,,"What is the four-stage handshake used for? 
A. Passing keys 
B.Deriving keys 
C.Encrypting messages 
D.Initialization seeding","The correct answer is B.
 The four-stage handshake is used to authenticate stations against wireless networks. As part of the handshake, encryption keys are generated. Keys are derived on both sides of the transaction rather than being exchanged directly. This is handled during the four-way handshake. Keys are not passed. Messages can’t be encrypted until the four-way handshake is complete and the keys are generated. There is no such thing as initialization seeding."
C,C,,,,"What is the SSID used for? 
A. Encrypting messages 
B.Providing a MAC address 
C.Identifying a network 
D.Seeding a key","The correct answer is C.
 The service set identifier (SSID) is used to identify a network. It is the name of the network you would select when you were trying to connect to a network. The SSID is not the MAC address, and it has nothing to do with keys or encryption."
D,D,,,,"What kind of access point is being used in an evil twin attack? 
A. Infrastructure 
B.Ad hoc 
C.WPA 
D.Rogue","The correct answer is D.
 Ad hoc and infrastructure are types of wireless networks. Only infrastructure uses access points, but infrastructure is not a type of access point. WPA is an encryption protocol. A rogue access point, meaning one that isn’t legitimate, is used in an evil twin attack by pretending to be a legitimate access point."
B,B,,,,"How does an evil twin attack work? 
A. Phishing users for credentials 
B.Spoofing an SSID 
C.Changing an SSID 
D.Injecting four-way handshakes","The correct answer is B.
 An evil twin attack uses an access point masquerading as the point of connection for stations trying to connect to a legitimate wireless network. Stations reach out to make connections to this access point masquerading as another access point. While you may phish for credentials as part of an evil twin attack, credential phishing is not how evil twin attacks work. SSIDs don’t get changed as part of an evil twin attack, meaning no SSID that exists will become another SSID.
 Injecting four-way handshakes won’t do much, since four- way assumes both ends are communicating, so the injection of a full communication stream will get ignored."
C,C,,,,"What method might you use to successfully get malware onto a mobile device? 
A. Using the Apple Store or Google Play store 
B.Using external storage on an Android 
C.Using a third-party app store 
D.Jailbreaking","The correct answer is C.
 The Apple App Store and the Google Play Store are controlled by Apple and Google. It’s not impossible to get malware onto mobile devices through them, but it’s very difficult because apps get run through a vetting process. While some Android devices will support external storage, it’s not an effective way to get malware onto a smartphone or other mobile device. Jailbreaking can lead to malware being installed, but it’s not the means to get malware onto a mobile device. Third-party app stores can be a good means to get malware onto mobile devices because some third-party app stores don’t vet apps that are submitted."
B,B,,,,"What would you use a bluebugging attack for? 
A. Identifying Bluetooth devices nearby 
B.Listening to a physical space 
C.Enabling a phone’s camera 
D.Gathering data from a target system","The correct answer is B.
 A bluebugging attack is used to gain access to a smartphone in order to initiate a call out to the attacker’s phone. This allows the attacker to listen to anything happening around the phone owner. Scanning is used to identify Bluetooth devices nearby. There is no particular attack used to enable a phone’s camera. Gathering data from a target device or system is bluesnarfing."
A,A,,,,"What would a signal range for a Bluetooth device commonly be? 
A. 300 ft. 
B.3,000 ft. 
C.75 ft. 
D.500 ft.","The correct answer is A.
 While there are Bluetooth devices that will transmit much further, a common range is about 300 feet (100 meters) for Bluetooth 4.0."
D,D,,,,"What tool could you use to enable sniffing on your wireless network to acquire all headers? 
A. Ettercap 
B.Tcpdump 
C.Aircrack-ng 
D.Airmon-ng","The correct answer is D.
 Tcpdump can be used to capture frames/packets. Ettercap is used for captures and spoofing attacks. Neither can capture all headers, including radio headers in a wireless network. The package aircrack-ng includes the program airmon-ng, which can turn on monitor mode on a network interface. The program aircrack-ng itself cannot do that."
B,B,,,,"Why is bluesnarfing potentially more dangerous than bluejacking from the standpoint of the victim? 
A. Bluejacking sends while bluesnarfing receives. 
B.Bluejacking receives while bluesnarfing sends. 
C.Bluejacking installs keyloggers. 
D.Bluesnarfing installs keyloggers.","The correct answer is B.
 Bluesnarfing is an attack that connects to a Bluetooth device in order to grab data from that device. Bluesnarfing sends data to the attacker. Bluejacking can be used to send information to a Bluetooth device, such as a text message. Neither of these attacks install keyloggers."
C,C,,,,"What tool would allow you to run an evil twin attack? 
A. Wireshark 
B.Ettercap 
C.Wifiphisher 
D.Aircrack-ng","The correct answer is C.
 Wireshark is used to capture packets/frames from a network. Ettercap is used for spoofing attacks. The program aircrack-ng can be used to crack wireless keys. Wifiphisher, though, can be used to set up an evil twin attack."
B,B,,,,"What types of authentication are allowed in a WPA-encrypted network? 
A. Handshake and personal 
B.Personal and enterprise 
C.Enterprise and handshake 
D.802.11 and personal","The correct answer is B.
 WPA supports both Personal and Enterprise authentication. Personal authentication makes use of a pre-shared key, while Enterprise authentication uses usernames and passwords to authenticate specific users, providing accounting and access control, meaning we know exactly who has connected to the network."
D,D,,,,"What wouldn’t you see when you capture wireless traffic that includes radio headers? 
A. Capabilities 
B.Probe requests 
C.SSIDs 
D.Network type","The correct answer is D.
 Radio headers in a wireless network will provide you with the capabilities of the devices, since that’s negotiated during the association process. You will also see probe requests asking what networks are in the area, including specific networks that a station knows about. These requests will include the SSID.
 The responses will also include the SSID.
 You will not get the network type in the headers."
B,B,,,,"What protocol is used for a Smurf attack? 
A. DNS 
B.ICMP 
C.TCP 
D.SMTP","The correct answer is B.
 While DNS is also used for amplification attacks, Smurf attacks are a result of someone sending ICMP echo requests to the broadcast address of a network. The echo responses would be sent to the address in the source of the request, which would be spoofed. If enough systems respond, the volume of responses can overwhelm the target system."
C,C,,,,"If you were to see ' or 1=1; in a packet capture, what would you expect was happening? 
A. Cross-site scripting 
B.Command injection 
C.SQL injection 
D.XML external entity injection","The correct answer is C.
 An SQL injection attack makes use of SQL queries, which can include logic that may alter the flow of the application. In the example provided, the intent is to force the result of the SQL query to always return a true. It is quoted the way it is to escape the existing query already in place in the application. None of the other attacks use a syntax that looks like the example."
C,C,,,,"Which protocol is commonly used for amplification attacks? 
A. TCP 
B.SMTP 
C.DNS 
D.XML","The correct answer is C.
 Because TCP uses a three-way handshake, spoofing like that needed in amplification is very difficult. SMTP also uses TCP. XML is used for data structure and presentation. DNS is often used for modern amplification attacks."
A,A,,,,"What is the purpose of a SYN flood? 
A. Fill up connection buffers at the operating system 
B.Fill up connection buffers in the web server 
C.Fill up connection buffers at the Application layer 
D.Fill up connection buffers for UDP","The correct answer is A.
 A SYN flood takes advantage of the three-way handshake. A SYN message alone will consume a connection buffer at the operating system. Until the operating system has passed the three-way handshake, the request won’t make it to the web server at the Application layer. SYN is not a header flag used with UDP."
B,B,,,,"How does a slowloris attack work? 
A. Holds open connection buffers at the operating system 
B.Holds open connection buffers at the web server 
C.Holds open connection buffers at the Application layer 
D.Holds open connection buffers for UDP","The correct answer is B.
 A slowloris attack is used to hold open connection buffers at the web server. Enough of these requests will consume all of the possible connections for the web server. The Application layer doesn’t factor in here because there are no connection buffers at the Application layer. Web servers don’t use UDP for HTTP requests, and slowloris is an attack against a web server."
C,C,,,,"What would be the result of sending the string AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA into a variable that has been allocated space for 8 bytes? 
A. Heap spraying 
B.SQL injection 
C.Buffer overflow 
D.Slowloris attack","The correct answer is C.
 Heap spraying uses dynamically allocated space to store attack code. A slowloris attack is used to hold open web server connection buffers. An SQL injection will be used to inject SQL queries to the database server. A buffer overflow sends more data than space has been allocated for into the application."
D,D,,,,"What is the target of a cross-site scripting attack? 
A. Web server 
B.Database server 
C.Third-party server 
D.User","The correct answer is D.
 A cross-site scripting attack uses a scripting language to run in the browser. Since the browser is with the user, ultimately the attack targets the user, even if the injection code is stored in a database server."
D,D,,,,"If you were to see the following in a packet capture, what would you think was happening? <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM ""file:///etc/passwd"" >]> 
A. Cross-site scripting 
B.SQL injection 
C.Command injection 
D.XML external entity injection","The correct answer is D.
 Cross-site scripting attacks usually use JavaScript or perhaps VBScript. SQL injection uses SQL. Command injection uses operating system commands. The fragment shows XML using an external entity. This is, then, an XML external entity injection."
B,B,,,,"What protection could be used to prevent an SQL injection attack? 
A. Buffer overflows 
B.Input validation 
C.XML filtering 
D.Lateral movement","The correct answer is B.
 SQL injection attacks take data injected from the user/attacker. Any data sent in from a user should always be validated before being acted on. Nothing coming in from a user should be trusted. None of the other answers could be used to prevent an SQL injection attack."
A,A,,,,"What security element would be a crucial part of a defense in depth network design? 
A. Firewall 
B.SIEM 
C.Web application firewall 
D.Log management system","The correct answer is A.
 A defense in depth network design makes use of multiple prevention layers to make breaching the inside of the network quite a bit harder. A SIEM is used to collect and correlate intelligence and log data. A web application firewall protects against Application layer attacks. A log management system is just what it says. A firewall, though, is commonly used in a defense in depth network design."
A,A,,,,"What does a defense in breadth approach add? 
A. Consideration for a broader range of attacks 
B.Protection against SQL injection 
C.Buffer overflow protection 
D.Heap spraying protection","The correct answer is A.
 Defense in breadth starts with defense in depth and takes a broader range of attack strategies into consideration. Defense in breadth doesn’t necessarily protect against SQL injection and probably doesn’t protect against buffer overflows or heap spraying attacks. Those protections may possibly be achieved, but ultimately defense in breadth would achieve them by taking a broader range of attacks into consideration."
C,C,,,,"What attack injects code into dynamically allocated memory? 
A. Buffer overflow 
B.Cross-site scripting 
C.Heap spraying 
D.Slowloris","The correct answer is C.
 A buffer overflow attack is an attack against data in the stack, which is known about at compile time and, as a result, is not dynamic. Cross-site scripting attacks and slowloris attacks don’t inject code into memory. A heap spraying attack, though, injects code into the heap, which is where dynamically allocated memory is taken from."
C,C,,,,"If you were to see the following in a packet capture, what attack would you expect is happening? %3Cscript%3Ealert('wubble');%3C/script%3E 
A. SQL injection 
B.Command injection 
C.Cross-site scripting 
D.Buffer overflow","The correct answer is C.
 A buffer overflow takes an excess amount of data and tries to store it into a memory location that can’t accommodate it. An SQL injection attack uses SQL. Command injection attacks use operating system commands. A cross-site scripting attack uses a scripting language such as JavaScript or VBScript. The script is injected using a <script> HTML tag, and the %3C is a way of encoding < while %3E is a way of encoding >. This means %3Cscript%3E would be decoded to <script>."
B,B,,,,"What has been done to the following string? %3Cscript%3Ealert('wubble');%3C/script%3E 
A. Base64 encoding 
B.URL encoding 
C.Encryption 
D.Cryptographic hashing","The correct answer is B.
 Base64 encoding takes non-printable characters and encodes them in a way that they can be rendered in text. Encryption would generally render text unreadable to people. A cryptographic hash is a way of generating a fixed-length value. URL encoding takes text and uses hexadecimal values to represent the characters. This is text that has been converted into hexadecimal so they can be used in a URL."
D,D,,,,"What technique does a slow read attack use? 
A. Small HTTP header requests 
B.Small HTTP body requests 
C.Small HTTP POST requests 
D.Small file retrieval requests","The correct answer is D.
 A slowloris attack uses small HTTP requests to hold open a web server’s available connections. There are attacks that use body requests in a slow fashion. However, a slow read attack tries to download"
D,D,,,,"What element could be used to facilitate log collection, aggregation, and correlation? 
A. Log manager 
B.Firewall 
C.IDS 
D.SIEM","The correct answer is D.
 While a firewall and an IDS will generate logs, they don’t collect them. A log manager will collect logs and perhaps aggregate them, but it probably doesn’t correlate log messages. A SIEM, though, will consume logs, aggregate them, and correlate them."
A,A,,,,"What is the target of a command injection attack? 
A. Operating system 
B.Web server 
C.Database server 
D.User","The correct answer is A.
 A command injection sends operating system commands into a web application so they can be run by the operating system. The web server (meaning the web server application) is not the target of the command injection, nor is the database server or the user."
C,C,,,,"What would the Low Orbit Ion Cannon be used for? 
A. SQL injection attacks 
B.Log management 
C.Denial of service attacks 
D.Buffer overflows","The correct answer is C.
 The Low Orbit Ion Cannon is a .NET-based application used to launch denial of service attacks. It is not used for log management or SQL injection attacks, nor is it used for buffer overflows."
B,B,,,,"What could you use to inform a defensive strategy? 
A. SIEM output 
B.Attack life cycle 
C.Logs 
D.Intrusion detection system","The correct answer is B.
 SIEM output is useful and may have some value in understanding current attacks. The same is true with logs and intrusion detection systems. However, the attack life cycle is a structured way to understand how attacks happen in order to better inform a defensive strategy so controls can be implemented for each of the phases of the attack."
C,C,,,,"What information does a buffer overflow intend to control? 
A. Stack pointer 
B.Frame pointer 
C.Instruction pointer 
D.Buffer pointer","The correct answer is C.
 The stack pointer indicates where the stack is in memory. The frame pointer indicates which part of the stack is being used for the current frame. There is no buffer pointer from the perspective of the operating system, though applications do use pointers and they do point to buffers. An instruction pointer tells the processor where the next instruction to be executed is. Controlling this piece of information can allow the attacker to control the execution flow of the program."
C,C,,,,"With a rotation of 4, what does erwaiv decrypt to? 
A. waive 
B.wave 
C.answer 
D.decrypt","The correct answer is C.
 This is a rotation cipher with a key of 4. When you rotate the alphabet by 4, you end up with e = a, r = n, w = s, and so on. In addition to not being the right decryption, none of the others have the correct number of letters. In a substitution cipher like a rotation cipher, you will always have the same number of letters in the output as you do in the input."
B,B,,,,"What do you call a message before it is encrypted? 
A. Text 
B.Plain text 
C.Bare words 
D.Bare text","The correct answer is B.
 In cryptography, any data or message that is in an unencrypted state is called plaintext. The output from a cryptographic process is ciphertext. While you may have text as input to an encryption process, the word text would be ambiguous in this context. The other two are unrelated to cryptography."
C,C,,,,"What does PGP use to verify identity? 
A. Central authority 
B.Web of users 
C.Web of trust 
D.Central trust authority","The correct answer is C.
 Where certificate authorities use a centralized mechanism for verification of users or certificate subjects, PGP uses a decentralized model. PGP calls this a web of trust, where individual users sign keys that belong to other people to validate that they are who they say they are. All of the other answers are made-up terms."
A,A,,,,"What principle is used to demonstrate that a signed message came from the owner of the key that signed it? 
A. Non-repudiation 
B.Non-verifiability 
C.Integrity 
D.Authority","The correct answer is A.
 Integrity is part of the CIA triad but isn’t the principle that ties a signed message back to the subject of the signing certificate. Non-verifiability is nonsense, and authority isn’t relevant here. Instead, non-repudiation means someone can’t say they didn’t send a message if it was signed with their key. This assumes the key was in their possession and password protected, meaning no one else could use it."
C,C,,,,"What is Diffie-Hellman used for? 
A. Key management 
B.Key isolation 
C.Key exchange 
D.Key revocation","The correct answer is C.
 Certificates can be revoked but that’s not what Diffie-Hellman is used for. Key management is a much broader topic than key exchange, which is what Diffie-Hellman is used for. It is a process that allows two parties to an encrypted conversation to mutually derive the same key starting with the same base value."
D,D,,,,"How did 3DES improve on DES? 
A. Made the key longer 
B.Used two keys 
C.Changed algorithms 
D.Used three keys","The correct answer is D.
 3DES, or Triple DES, uses three keys. The first key is used to encrypt the plaintext. The second key is used to decrypt the ciphertext resulting from the first round of encryption. Finally, the third key is used to encrypt the ciphertext that resulted from the decryption with the second key. The key wasn’t made longer because the 168 bits used in 3DES aren’t used in a single key. The underlying DES algorithm is still used."
A,A,,,,"What improvement does elliptic curve cryptography make? 
A. Smaller keys improve speed 
B.Algorithm is more complex 
C.Doesn’t use factoring, which is better 
D.Longer keys","The correct answer is A.
 Algorithms used for elliptic curve cryptography are not more complex, necessarily. While they don’t use factoring, that fact alone doesn’t necessarily make the algorithms better. Instead, elliptic curve cryptography relies on the assumption that determining a discrete logarithm of a point on an elliptic curve can’t be computed in a consistent way. The keys that result from elliptic key cryptography are actually smaller than those that result from factoring with large prime numbers."
B,B,,,,"What is it called when two different data sets yield the same cryptographic hash? 
A. Paradox 
B.Collision 
C.Crash 
D.Unrealistic","The correct answer is B.
 When two different data sets yield the same cryptographic hash, it is called a collision. It relates to a mathematical problem called the birthday paradox, but two values being the same is not a paradox. It’s also not unrealistic, nor is it a crash."
C,C,,,,"Which of the following terms can be used in a description of asymmetric key encryption? 
A. Private key 
B.Multifactor 
C.Public key 
D.Single factor","The correct answer is C.
 Asymmetric key cryptography uses two related keys. One key is used for encryption and one is used for decryption. These keys are referred to as the public and private key. Because it’s the public key that is used to encrypt messages to the owner of the paired private key, this type of encryption is commonly referred to as public key cryptography. It is neither single factor nor multifactor since it’s not authentication."
C,C,,,,"If Alice were to send an email to Bob, what key would she use to encrypt the message? 
A. PGP key 
B.Private key 
C.Public key 
D.Symmetric key","The correct answer is C.
 Public key cryptography works because the public key can be provided to anyone. The only thing you can do with the public key is encrypt a message that could be decrypted by the matched private key. This process uses asymmetric encryption, so it’s not a symmetric key. The private key has to be with the owner of the key and protected. If that key gets out, any messages encrypted to the owner by the public key could be decrypted. PGP uses public/private keys and does not have its own type of key."
D,D,,,,"What property allows you to trust someone trusted by a certificate authority you trust? 
A. Commutative property 
B.Associative property 
C.Communicative property 
D.Transitive property","The correct answer is D.
 What this says is that if A trusts B and B trusts C, then A can trust C.
 This is an application of the transitive property. The commutative and associative properties are both also mathematical principles. There is no such thing as a communicative property."
A,A,,,,"Why is symmetric key encryption typically used over asymmetric key encryption? 
A. It’s faster. 
B.It’s more secure. 
C.It’s easier to implement. 
D.It isn’t encumbered with patents.","The correct answer is A.
 Symmetric key encryption is generally used instead of asymmetric key encryption because symmetric key encryption uses shorter keys and fewer resources, resulting in shorter times for encryption and decryption. This does not make it more secure, even if that word were to be defined in this context. Symmetric key is not easier to implement and asymmetric key is not encumbered with patents, which is why C and D are wrong."
B,B,,,,"What is it called when both symmetric and asymmetric keys are used? 
A. Fast cryptosystem 
B.Hybrid cryptosystem 
C.Super-symmetric cryptosystem 
D.Dual key cryptosystem","The correct answer is B.
 When both symmetric and asymmetric keys are used, typically where the asymmetric key is used to protect the symmetric key, it is called a hybrid cryptosystem. The other options don’t exist."
D,D,,,,"What is MD5 or SHA-1 commonly used for in cryptography? 
A. Media access control (MAC) 
B.Machine authentication code (MAC) 
C.Message access code (MAC) 
D.Message authentication code (MAC)","The correct answer is D.
 Media access control (MAC) is an address attached to physical network interfaces. The correct answer is message authentication code because SHA-1 and MD-5 are used as message authentication codes to ensure that a message has not been tampered with. This means it is being authenticated."
B,B,,,,"What type of encryption does PGP use? 
A. Symmetric key 
B.Asymmetric key 
C.Trusted key 
D.Web key","The correct answer is B.
 PGP uses public and private keys. The public key is stored in a public place like a key repository. Since there are two keys, PGP uses asymmetric key encryption, sometimes known as public key encryption."
B,B,,,,"Which of the security triad properties does the Biba security model relate to? 
A. Confidentiality 
B.Integrity 
C.Availability 
D.All of them","The correct answer is B.
 The Biba security model covers data integrity. While other models cover confidentiality, none of them cover availability."
D,D,,,,"How many tiers are there in an n-tier application design? 
A. Two 
B.Three 
C.Four 
D.Depends on the application","The correct answer is D.
 An n-tier application, sometimes called a multitier application, can have as many tiers as necessary. While you may think there are three, there could be more tiers than that, depending on how the application is designed."
C,C,,,,"What type of database may JSON be most likely to represent? 
A. Relational 
B.SQL 
C.Key-value 
D.Document-based","The correct answer is C.
 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) uses keys and values to store data. While you could theoretically represent a relational database in JSON, it wouldn’t be the most efficient. SQL is a language used to query relational databases, and document-based databases may be more likely to use other document types to store data."
C,C,,,,"How many functions are specified by NIST’s cybersecurity framework? 
A. None 
B.Three 
C.Five 
D.Four","The correct answer is C.
 The NIST cybersecurity framework specifies five functions: identify, protect, detect, response, recover."
C,C,,,,"How many steps in the ISO 27001 cycle? 
A. Two 
B.Three 
C.Four 
D.Five","The correct answer is C.
 The ISO 27001 specification takes a different approach than NIST’s cybersecurity framework. ISO 27001 specifies Plan, Do, Act, Check, which is four steps."
A,A,,,,"What is the highest level of classification used by the U.S. government? 
A. Top secret 
B.Confidential 
C.Restricted 
D.Eyes only","The correct answer is A.
 The highest level of classification used by the US government is top secret. Confidential and restricted are lower levels, and eyes only is not a classification used by the U.S. government."
D,D,,,,"Which of these is microservices a specific implementation of? 
A. Service object architecture 
B.Micro Channel architecture 
C.Micro services architecture

 this question gets you on two fronts. One regards knowledge on HINFO, and the other is nslookup use. First, the DNS record HINFO (per RFC 1035) is a resource type that indentifies values for CPU type anf operating system. Are you absolutely trquired to include an HINFO record for each host in your network? No, not at all. Shuold you? I'am sure there's some reason, somewhere anf sometime, that adding HINFO makes sense, but I certainly can't think of one. In other words, this is great record type to remember for your exam, but your chances of seeing it in use in the real world rank somewhere between seeing lobster on the menu at McDonald's ang catching a leprechaun riding a unicorn through your backyard. 
Nslookup syntax is the second portion od this question, and you'll definitely need to know it. The syntax for the tool is fairly simple:
nslookup [-options] {hostname  | [-server]}
The command can be used as a single instance, providing information based on the options you choose, or you can use it in interactive mode, with the command running as a tool, awaiting input from you. For example, on a Microsoft Windows machine, if you simply type nslookup at the prompt, you�ll see a display showing your default DNS server and its associated IP address. From there, nslookup sits patiently, waiting for you to ask whatever you want (as an aside, this is known as interactive mode). Typing a question mark shows all the options and switches you have available."

 You probably knew, right up front, this was a traceroute question, but the trick comes when deciding which traceroute command to use. Traceroute, depending on which system you use it on, can use a variety of different protocols and techniques. For example, on Windows systems, traceroute (using the command name tracert) uses ICMP packets and the TTL (time to live) value to map out a path between origin and destination. The first packet sent uses a TTL of 1, to show the first hop. The next packet sets it to 2, and so on, until the destination is found. Each ICMP response provides information on the current hop (unless ICMP is being filtered). On a Linux system (and on Cisco devices), you�d use the command traceroute, and UDP would be used instead of ICMP."

This one may be a little tricky, but only because we live and work in the real world and this is an exam question. EC-Council has several questionable takes on things regarding real-world application and what they say you should remember for your exam, and this is one of those examples. Just remember ECC wants you to know active and passive footprinting can be defined by two things: what you touch and how much discovery risk you put yourself in. Social engineering in and of itself is not all passive or active in nature. In the case of dumpster diving, it�s also considered passive (despite the real-world risk of discovery and the action you have to take to pull it off) according to ECC.
 However, pick up a phone and call someone inside the company or talk to people in the parking lot, and you�ve exposed yourself to discovery and are now practicing active footprinting. As far as �passive� sniffing goes, sniffing isn�t a footprinting action at all. The term �passive sniffing� concerns the act of simply plugging in and watching what comes by, without any packet injection or other action required on your part."

 The HINFO record type is one of those really great ideas that was designed to make life easier for everyone and turned out to be a horrible idea. Defined in RFC 1035, Host Information (HINFO) DNS records were originally intended to provide the type of computer and operating system a host uses (back in the day, you could also put things like room numbers and other descriptions in the record). However, to avoid publicly advertising that information (for obvious reasons), this record type simply isn�t used much anymore. And if you find one on a public-facing machine, it�s a sure sign of incompetence on the part of the server administrators. In this example, the type is set to HINFO, and a machine name�someserver�is provided. The attacker can use the information contained in the record as a enumeration source."
C,C,"A is incorrect because dynamic DNS doesn�t work this way. In �regular� DNS, a name is tied to a static IP address; however, for any number of reasons, a hosted device may need to change its IP address often.

That way, even though a domain name�s IP address changes, users don�t have to do anything out of the ordinary to continue service�the dynamic DNS service will ensure they�re pointed in the right direction.","B is incorrect because Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of IETF specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by DNS.

 The idea behind split DNS is pretty simple: create two zones for the same domain, with one just for the internal network, while the other is used by any external networks. Internal hosts are directed to the internal domain name server. Separating the domain servers greatly limits the footprinting an attacker can perform from the outside."

While you could make a technical argument ARP poisoning might work in this scenario, the key point was to focus on the explicit network segment DNS signs.

 DNS poisoning makes the most sense here.

In this example, John�s connection from home uses a different DNS server for lookups than that of the business network. It�s entirely possible someone has changed the cache entries in his local server to point to a different IP than the one hosting the real website�or that the hackers have set up to provide the defaced version. The fact that the web files haven�t changed and the site seems to be displaying just fine from inside the network also backs this up. If it turns out John�s DNS modification is the only one in place, there is a strong likelihood that John is being specifically targeted for exploitation�something John should take very seriously.

A. MSF Core","The correct answer is B.
 If you have a Windows Active Directory (AD) network, having AD-integrated DNS servers offers some great advantages. For example (and directly from Microsoft, I might add), 'with directory-integrated storage, dynamic updates to DNS are conducted based upon a multimaster update model. In this model, any authoritative DNS server, such as a domain controller running a DNS server, is designated as a primary source for the zone. Because the master copy of the zone is maintained in the Active Directory database, which is fully replicated to all domain controllers, the zone can be updated by the DNS servers operating on any domain controller for the domain.' Zones are also replicated and synchronized to new domain controllers automatically whenever a new one is added to an Active Directory domain, and directory replication is faster and more efficient than standard DNS replication. But having an Active Directory server facing externally is a horrible idea. "

SRV (Service): This record defines the hostname and port number of servers providing specific services, such as a Directory Services server.
SOA (Start of Authority): This record identifies the primary name server for the zone. The SOA record contains the hostname of the server responsible for all DNS records within the namespace as well as the basic properties of the domain.
PTR (Pointer): This record maps an IP address to a hostname (providing for reverse DNS lookups). You don�t absolutely need a PTR record for every entry in your DNS namespace, but PTR records are usually associated with email server records.
NS (Name Server): This record defines the name servers within your namespace. These servers are the ones that respond to your client�s requests for name resolution.
MX (Mail Exchange): This record identifies your email servers within your domain.
CNAME (Canonical Name): This record provides for domain name aliases within your zone. For example, you may have an FTP server and a web service running on the same IP address. CNAME records could be used to list both within DNS for you.
A (Address): This record maps an IP address to a hostname and is used most often for DNS lookups."

B,B,"A is incorrect because an Inverse TCP Flag scan is one in which TCP probe flags are

sending an initial FIN packet followed by an ACK packet, using discrepancies

B. The zombie system is a honeypot.
C. There is a misbehaving firewall between you and the zombie machine.
D. This is an expected result during an IDLE scan.","The correct answer is A.
 An IDLE scan makes use of a zombie machine and IP�s knack for incrementing
fragment identifiers (IPIDs). However, it is absolutely essential the zombie remain
idle to all other traffic during the scan. The attacker will send packets to the target
with the (spoofed) source address of the zombie. If the port is open, the target will
respond to the SYN packet with a SYN/ACK, but this will be sent to the zombie. The
zombie system will then craft a RST packet in answer to the unsolicited SYN/ACK,
and the IPID will increase. If this occurs randomly, then it�s probable your zombie is
not in fact idle, and your results are moot. See, if it�s not idle, it�s going to increment
haphazardly because communications from the device will be shooting hither and

D. It appears port 4083 is closed.","The correct answer is B, D.
 The exam will ask you to define scan types in many, many ways. It may be a
simple definition match; sometimes it�ll be some crazy Wireshark or tcpdump listing. In
this example, you see a cleaned-up traffic exchange showing packets from one host being
sent one after another to the second host, indicating a scan attempt. The packets have the
FIN, URG, and PSH flags all set, which tells you it�s an XMAS scan. If the destination
port is open, you won�t receive anything back; if it�s closed, you�ll see a RST/ACK. This
tells you port 4083 looks like it�s closed (see line four of the response). As an addendum,
did you know there are two reasons why it�s called an XMAS scan? The first is because it
lights up an IDS like a Christmas tree, and the second is because the flags themselves are
all lit. As an aside, you probably won�t see this much out in the real world because it just
really doesn�t have much applicability. But on your exam? Oh yes�it�ll be there."

why it�s unreachable. Code 13 indicates �communication administratively prohibited,�

designer is nice enough to configure the device to respond in such a way, and you�ll
probably never get that nicety in the real world, but the definitions of what the �type�

 Do you remember network address translation? It�s a neat little technology

the Internet by borrowing and using a single address (or a group of addresses)
managed by a router or other system. IP masquerading is much the same thing;
it�s just accomplished through a Linux host. In short, a Linux machine can act as
a NAT translator by employing proper routing configuration, using one NIC to
communicate with the internal network and one with the external network, and
enabling IP masquerading.

ipset.netfilter.org/iptables.man.html), we see that iptables is an administration tool
for IPv4 packet filtering and NAT. Per the man page, �Iptables is used to set up,
maintain, and inspect the tables of IPv4 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. Several
different tables may be defined.� Each table contains a number of built-in chains
and may be enabled by iptables -t tablename -switch, where tablename is filter, nat,
mangle, raw, or security, and switch equates to the option you wish to enable. For
example, -A appends rules, -D deletes rules, and -R replaces rules."

 Per Microsoft, regarding the nbtstat command: �Nbtstat is designed to help
troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution problems. When a network is functioning
normally, NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) resolves NetBIOS names to IP addresses.
It does this through several options for NetBIOS name resolution, including local
cache lookup, WINS server query, broadcast, LMHOSTS lookup, Hosts lookup,
and DNS server query. The nbtstat command removes and corrects preloaded entries
using a number of case-sensitive switches.� Syntax for the command includes the
following:
� nbtstat - a <name> Performs a NetBIOS adapter status command on the
computer name specified by <name>. The adapter status command returns the
local NetBIOS name table for that computer as well as the MAC address of the
adapter card.
� nbtstat -A <IP address> Performs the same function as the -a switch, but using
a target IP address rather than a name.
� nbtstat - c Shows the contents of the NetBIOS name cache, which contains
NetBIOS-name-to-IP-address mappings.
� nbtstat -n Displays the names that have been registered locally on the system
by NetBIOS applications such as the server and redirector.
� nbtstat -r Displays the count of all NetBIOS names resolved by broadcast and
by querying a WINS server.
� nbtstat -R Purges the name cache and reloads all #PRE entries from the
LMHOSTS file (#PRE entries are the LMHOSTS name entries that are preloaded
into the cache).
� nbtstat -RR Sends name release packets to the WINS server and starts a refresh,
thus re-registering all names with the name server without a reboot being required.
� nbtstat -S Lists current NetBIOS sessions and their status, including statistics."

the definition of what constitutes a server and what does not is a blurred line. If your
printer allows Telnet access to a terminal, is it really just a printer? For that matter,
many printers actually work off of an embedded operating system. In other words,
in real-world testing, your printer may actually be a Linux OS server of sorts. Your

 A half-open scan, as defined by this nmap command line, is the best option in

scan was simply too noisy (or created more entries in an application-level logging
system, whichever your preference). As far as the real world is concerned, it�s a
fact that most IDSs can pick up a SYN scan just as easily as a full connect, but
if you go slow enough, both a SYN and a full connect can be almost invisible. A
connect scan is indistinguishable from a real connection, whereas a SYN scan can
definitely be distinguishable. In other words, the full connect will look like any other
conversation�just bunches of them all at once�whereas a SYN scan will show a
lot of systems answering a conversation starter only to be met with rude silence. The
lesson is any scan can and probably will be seen in the real world by a monitoring
IDS; however, the slower you go and the better you characterize your target without
putting additional packets on the wire, the less chance you�ll have of being seen, all
things being equal."

 This one requires a bit of background knowledge, so read on.
In October 2000, SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) became an IETF
Proposed Standard and was published as RFC 2960. It was originally designed
within the IETF Signaling Transport (SIGTRAN) working group to address TCP�s
shortcomings relating to telephony signaling over IP networks, and it has since
evolved into a general-purpose IETF transport protocol. SCTP provides a connectionoriented, reliable, full-duplex, congestion- and flow-controlled layer 4 channel;
however, unlike both TCP and UDP, SCTP offers new delivery options that better
match diverse applications� needs.
Whereas you�re probably familiar with the three-way handshake of TCP, SCTP uses
a four-way handshake (you can read all the technical details at https://datatracker.ietf
.org/doc/html/rfc4960):
1. The client sends an INIT signal to the server to initiate an association.
2. On receipt of the INIT signal, the server sends an INIT-ACK response to the
client. This INIT-ACK signal also contains a �state cookie.� This cookie holds
an assortment of information, including a message authentication code (MAC),
a timestamp corresponding to the creation of the cookie, the life span of the state
cookie, and other information necessary to establish the connection.
3. On receipt of this INIT-ACK signal, the client sends a COOKIE-ECHO response,
which just echoes the state cookie.
4. The server verifies the state cookie�s authenticity and allocates the resources for
the association, sends a COOKIE-ACK response acknowledging the COOKIEECHO signal, and moves the association to the ESTABLISHED state.
Shutdown for SCTP is just as graceful:
1. The client sends a SHUTDOWN signal to the server.
2. The server responds by sending a SHUTDOWN-ACK acknowledgement.
3. The client then sends a SHUTDOWN-COMPLETE signal back to the server.
SCTP can also abruptly close, using an ABORT signal due to an error in the SCTP
stack or at the request of the client. SCTP does not support half-open connections.
An SCTP INIT scan sends SCTP INIT �chunks� to targets and awaits responses.
If the response is INIT+ACK, the port is open; an ABORT response means the port
is closed."

 Yes, it is true that port 80 traffic is generally HTTP; however, there are
two problems with this statement. The first is all that is happening here is an
arbitrary connection to something on port 80. For all we know, it�s a listener, Telnet
connection, or anything at all. Second, assuming it�s actually an HTTP server, the
sequence described here would do nothing but make a connection�not necessarily
transfer anything. Sure, this is picky, but it�s the truth. Next, sequence numbers are
acknowledged between systems during the three-way handshake by incrementing
by 1. In this example, the source sent an opening sequence number of 10 to the
recipient. The recipient, in crafting the SYN/ACK response, will first acknowledge
the opening sequence number by incrementing it to 11. After this, it will add its own
sequence number to the packet (a random number it will pick) and send both off."

A. SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK
B. SYN, FIN, URG, and PSH
C. ACK, ACK, SYN, URG
D. SYN/ACK only","The correct answer is A.
 You�ll see bunches of Wireshark questions on your exam�it�s probably the subject
EC-Council loves the most regarding this chapter�and syntax will be the key to
answering all of them. For this particular question subject, remember Wireshark has
the ability to filter based on a hexadecimal numbering system assigned to TCP flags.
The assigned flag hex numbers are FIN = 1, SYN = 2, RST = 4, PSH = 8, ACK = 16,
and URG = 32. Putting these hex numbers together (for example, SYN + ACK = 12)
allows you to simplify a Wireshark filter. For example, tcp.flags == 0x2 looks for
SYN packets, tcp.flags == 0x16 looks for ACK packets, and tcp.flags == 0x12
looks for both (the attacker here will see all SYN packets, all SYN/ACK packets,
and all ACK packets). In this example, the decimal numbers were used, just not in a
simplified manner.
As far as the rest of Wireshark filtering syntax goes, there are a couple key points
to remember. First, be sure to remember it uses double �equals� signs (==) in the
expression (ip.addr = 10.10.10.0/24 won�t work, but ip addr == 10.10.10.0/24
will). Next, know the difference between the definitions for �and� and �or.� An �and�
in the filter means both expressions will be queried and displayed, but only if both
are true. (In other words, �Show me all packets containing this source address and
headed toward this destination IP. If it�s from this source but going somewhere else,
ignore it. If it�s headed to this destination but is not from this source, ignore it.�)
An �or� in the filter means either of the expressions can be true (that is, �Show me all
packets containing this source address and any packets going to this destination IP,
no matter the destination or source address, respectively, for the two�)."
B,B,"A is incorrect because the unicast destination MAC does not match the attacker�s

An attacker (with a MAC of 78:91:00:ED:BC:A1) is attached to a separate port on the same
switch with a packet capture running. There is no spanning of ports or port security

E1:22:BA:87:AC:12. Message 2 has a destination MAC of FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. Which of
the following statements is true regarding the messages being sent?
A. The attacker will see message 1.
B. The attacker will see message 2.
C. The attacker will see both messages.
D. The attacker will see neither message","The correct answer is B.
 This question is all about how a switch works, with a little MAC knowledge thrown
in. Remember that switches are designed to filter unicast messages but to flood
multicast and broadcast messages (filtering goes to only one port, whereas flooding
sends to all). Broadcast MAC addresses in the frame are easy to spot�they�re
always all Fs, indicating all 48 bits turned on in the address. In this case, message 1
is a unicast address and went off to its destination, whereas message 2 is clearly a
broadcast message, which the switch will gladly flood to all ports, including the
attacker�s.
Other versions of this same question will center on the efforts an attacker can use to
see that packet. Should the attacker desire to see all messages, a MAC flood could
turn the switch into a hub, effectively flooding all packets to all ports. Another
option is to span a port (break into the configuration of the switch and tell it to send
all traffic destined for a specific port to that port and to the attacker�s). Lastly, port
stealing (a totally fun memorization term from EC-Council) allows an attacker to
take advantage of the race condition (where the switch is constantly updating MAC
address bindings for ports) during a MAC flood attempt to effectively steal a port and
sniff all traffic aimed for the target machine."

C. ARP poisoning to allow you to see messages from Host B to Host A
D. ARP poisoning to allow you to see messages from Host A destined to any address
E. ARP poisoning to allow you to see messages from Host B destined to any address","The correct answer is B.
 ARP poisoning is a relatively simple way to place yourself as the �man in the
middle� and spy on traffic (by the way, be careful with the term man in the middle
because it usually refers to a position where you are not interrupting traffic). The
ARP cache is updated whenever your machine does a name lookup or when ARP
(a broadcast protocol) receives an unsolicited message advertising a MAC-to-IP
match. In this example, you�ve told Host A that you hold the MAC address for
Host B.
 Host A will update its cache, and when a message is being crafted by the
OS, it will happily put the spoofed address in its place. Just remember that ARP
poisoning is oftentimes noisy and may be easy to discover if port security is enabled:
depending on implementation, the port will lock (or amber in nerd terminology)
when an incorrect MAC tries to use it or when multiple broadcasts claiming different
MACs are seen. Additionally, watch out for denial-of-service side effects of
attempting ARP poisoning�you may well bring down a target without even trying
to, not to mention Host B is eventually going to find out it�s not receiving anything
from Host A.
 As a side note, detection of ARP poisoning can be done with a tool
called xARP (www.chrismc.de)."

D. TCP over DNS","The correct answer is D.
 Of the choices provided, TCP over DNS is the only one that makes any sense.
TCP over DNS is exactly what it sounds like�sending TCP traffic that would
otherwise use a different port number in packets using port 53. Because the firewall
usually allows DNS requests to pass, hiding traffic under port 53 is convenient and
fairly easy. The whole thing does require a special DNS server and DNS client setup,
but the steps to pull it off aren�t rocket science. While TCP over DNS will allow you
to evade the firewall and send traffic internally, it will not provide you instant access to
machines or anything like that�it simply allows you to send traffic unnoticed througha firewall. TCP over DNS tools include Iodine (http://code.kryo.se/iodine/), DNS
Tunnel (http://dnstunnel.de), and Netcross (https://sourceforge.net/projects/netcross).
Another very common option for passing traffic through a firewall is HTTP tunneling.

 A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) only works well if it can see all the
network traffic, and placement obviously makes a huge difference. One common
implementation is to connect via a SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer) port on a switch.
The configuration for a SPAN port ensures all traffic from a defined range of ports is
also sent to the SPAN port. This makes the best option for your NIDS tap, at least as
far as this question goes: in the real world, you would most likely set up a passive tap,
positioned in the correct location to see everything coming across the wire."

network or to disable some of the traffic isolation features of a switch? (Choose two.)
A. DHCP starvation
B. MAC flooding
C. Promiscuous mode
D. ARP spoofing","The correct answer is B, D.
 Switches filter all traffic�unless you tell them otherwise, make them behave
differently, or the traffic is broadcast or multicast. If you can gain administrative
access to the IOS, you can tell it to behave otherwise by configuring a span port
(which sends copies of messages from all ports to yours). Legitimate span ports are
designed for things such as a network IDS. To make the switch behave differently
(at least on older switches, because newer ones don�t allow this much anymore), send
more MAC addresses to the switch than it can handle. This fills the CAM and turns
the switch, effectively, into a hub (sometimes called a fail open state). Using a tool
such as MacOF or Yersinia, you can send thousands and thousands of fake MAC
addresses to the switch�s CAM table. ARP spoofing doesn�t really involve the switch
much at all�it continues to act and filter traffic just as it was designed to do. The
only difference is you�ve lied to it by faking a MAC address on a connected port.The poor switch, believing those happy little ARP messages, will forward all packets
destined for that MAC address to you instead of the intended recipient. How fun!"

C. To discover the sniffer, configure the IDS to watch for NICs in promiscuous mode.
D. It is almost impossible to discover the sniffer on the network.","The correct answer is D.
 This question is more about active versus passive sniffing than anything else. I�m
not saying it�s impossible, because almost nothing is, but discovering a passive sniffer
on your network is very difficult. When a NIC is set to promiscuous mode, it just
blindly accepts any packet coming by and sends it up the layers for further processing
(which is what allows Wireshark and other sniffers to analyze the traffic). Because
sniffers are sitting there pulling traffic and not sending anything in order to get it,
they�re difficult to detect. Active sniffing is another thing altogether. If a machine is
ARP spoofing or MAC flooding in order to pull off sniffing, it�s much easier to spot it."

B. Setting all NICs to promiscuous mode
C. Using private VLANs
D. Using static ARP entries","The correct answer is A, C, D.
 ARPWALL is an application available for download from SourceForge

attack occurs and simply blocks the connection. Virtual LANs (VLANs) provide a
means to create multiple broadcast domains within a single network. Machines on
the same switch are in different networks, and their traffic is isolated. Since ARP
works on broadcast, this can help prevent large-scale ARP spoofing. Per courseware,
static ARP entries are a good idea and at least one way to fix ARP poisoning, since
no matter what is banging around out on the network, the system uses the static
mapping you configured. An IDS may also be helpful in spotting ARP shenanigans,
but it wouldn�t necessarily do anything about them."

 To understand this, you have to know how a NIC is designed to work. The NIC
�sees� lots of traffic but pulls in only the traffic it knows belongs to you. It does this
by comparing the MAC address of each frame against its own: if they match, it pulls
the frame in and works on it; if they don�t match, the frame is ignored. If you plug
a sniffer into a NIC that looks only at traffic designated for the machine you�re on,
you�ve kind of missed the point, wouldn�t you say? Promiscuous mode tells the NIC
to pull in everything. This allows you to see all those packets moving to and fro inside
your collision domain. WinPcap is a library that allows NICs on Windows machines
to operate in promiscuous mode."
B,B,"A is incorrect because false positives occur when legitimate traffic is alerted on as

the following best describes the actions of the NIDS?
A. False positives
B. False negatives
C. True positives
D. True negatives","The correct answer is B.
 When it comes to alerting systems, false negatives are much more concerning than
false positives. A false negative occurs when traffic and circumstances are in place
for an attack signature, but the IDS does not trigger an alert. In other words, if your
system is firing a lot of false negatives, the security staff may feel like they�re secure
when, in reality, they�re really under a successful attack. Keep in mind a false negative
is different from your IDS simply not seeing the traffic. For example, if you tell
your IDS to send an alert for Telnet traffic and it simply didn�t see those packets (for
whatever reason), that may be a false negative for exam purposes but in the real worldis probably more of a configuration issue. A better example of a false negative in the
real world would be for the attacker to encrypt a portion of a payload so that the IDS
doesn�t recognize it as suspicious. In other words, the IDS sees the traffic, but it just
doesn�t recognize anything bad about it."

 This is one of those weird CEH definitions that drive us all crazy on the exam.
Knowing the definition of passive versus active isn�t really going to make you a better
pen tester, but it may save you a question on the test. When it comes to sniffing,
if you are not injecting packets into the stream, it�s a passive exercise. Tools such as
Wireshark are passive in nature. A tool such as Ettercap, though, has built-in features
to trick switches into sending all traffic its way, and other sniffing hilarity. This type
of sniffing, where you use packet interjection to force a response, is active in nature.
As a quick aside here, for you real-world preppers out there, true passive sniffing with
a laptop is pretty difficult to pull off. As soon as you attach a Windows machine, it�ll
start broadcasting all kinds of stuff (ARP and so on), which is, technically, putting
packets on the wire. The real point is that passive sniffing is a mindset where you are
not intentionally putting packets on a wire."

A. Block all UDP port 67 and 68 traffic.
B. Enable DHCP snooping on the switch.
C. Use port security on the switch.
D. Configure DHCP filters on the switch.","The correct answer is B, C.
 DHCP starvation is a denial-of-service attack EC-Council somehow slipped
into the sniffing section. The attack is pretty straightforward: the attacker requests all
available DHCP addresses from the server, so legitimate users cannot pull an address
and connect or communicate with the network subnet. DHCP snooping on a Cisco
switch (using the ip dhcp snooping command) creates a whitelist of machines that
are allowed to pull a DHCP address. Anything attempting otherwise can be filtered.
Port security, while not necessarily directly related to the attack, can be a means of
defense as well. By limiting the number of MACs associated with a port, as well
as whitelisting which specific MACs can address it, you could certainly reduce an
attacker�s ability to drain all DHCP addresses.
As a side note, you may also see a question relating to how DHCP works in the first
place. An easy way to remember it all is with the acronym DORA: Discover, Offer,
Request, and Acknowledge. Additionally, packets in DHCPv6 have different names
than those of DHCPv4. DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPOFFER, DHCPREQUEST,
and DHCPACK are known as Solicit, Advertise, Request (or Confirm/Renew), and
Reply, respectively."

 Let�s address the obvious up front: if your security is so weak someone can simply
walk into your offices and connect a switch�a switch�to your network without
anyone noticing, you have no security. OK, that said, let�s address the question�s
intent. EC-Council defines a �new� type of sniffing attack called an STP attack. STP
is a protocol used by switches to prevent broadcast loops within a segment. Basically,
the switches talk to one another and figure out which device has the lowest priority
(and in STP, the lowest number indicates the highest priority). This switch becomes
the root bridge, and broadcast storms are checked.
The idea here is the attacker uses STP to his advantage by forcing the rogue device
to become the bridge and setting its priority to zero, which helps in sniffing traffic
across multiple switches."

However, the stateful inspection firewall has the ability to examine the session details
regarding the packet and make a determination on its state. For a common (dare I
say, textbook) example, if a stateful firewall receives an ACK packet, it�s smart enough

headers individually and sees if they are implemented. Any output other than
501/405 suggests that the method is not in the range 400 to 600. If the response
falls under that range then it is compared to the response from a randomly generated
method. In this script, �potentially risky� methods are anything except GET, HEAD,
POST, and OPTIONS. If the script reports potentially risky methods, they may not
all be security risks, but you should check to make sure.� You can also use additional
parameters, such as url-path, to further hone your results. For example, output from
the preceding syntax showing PUT as a risky method might look like this:
PORT STATE SERVICE REASON
80/tcp open http syn-ack
| http-methods:
|_ Supported Methods: GET PUT HEAD POST OPTIONS
.....
Quite obviously, there is a lot of information tested in this one question�and many,
many ways you might see it on the exam. The HTTP options themselves will show
up somewhere, so knowing the difference, for example, between HTTP POST
(submits data to be processed and is normally allowable) and HTTP PUT (allows a
client to upload new files on the web server, which normally shouldn�t be allowed)
will become very important to your success. According to OWASP, the following
options are important to know:
� PUT This method allows a client to upload new files on the web server. An
attacker can exploit it by uploading malicious files (for example, an .asp file that
executes commands by invoking cmd.exe) or by simply using the victim�s server
as a file repository.
� DELETE This method allows a client to delete a file on the web server. An
attacker can exploit it as a very simple and direct way to deface a website or to
mount a DoS attack.
CONNECT This method could allow a client to use the web server as a proxy.
� TRACE This method simply echoes back to the client whatever string has
been sent to the server, and it�s used mainly for debugging purposes. This method,
originally assumed harmless, can be used to mount an attack known as
cross-site tracing."

testing technique, which basically consists in finding implementation bugs using
malformed/semi-malformed data injection in an automated fashion.� In other words,
fuzzing sends tons of weird inputs into fields to see what the application will do.
As an aside, you would find fuzzing in the Verification phase of Microsoft�s Security
Development Lifecycle (SDL). The entire SDL consists of training, requirements,
design, implementation, verification, release, and response. As a quick aside, fuzzing
isn�t necessarily a �random� process�it�s more an effort of controlled chaos."

A. CSPP
B. XSS
C. CSRF
D. Hidden form field","The correct answer is C.
 There are few guarantees in life, but here�s one: you will definitely be asked about

being described here�an attacker takes advantage of an open, active, authenticated
session between the victim and a trusted site, sending message requests to the
trusted site as if they are coming from the victim�s own browser. Usually this involves
phishing, or maybe an advertisement, but the principle is always the same. CSRF
attacks can be prevented by configuring random challenge tokens, which allow the
server to verify user requests.
As an aside, a similar attack is known as session fixation. The attacker logs into a
legitimate site, pulls a session ID, and then sends an e-mail with a link containing
the fixed session ID.

hacker then logs in and runs with the user�s credentials."

 Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a protocol designed for exchanging

words, it�s a way for a program running in one kind of operating system (let�s say
Windows Server 2019 or 2020) to communicate with a program on another (such
as Linux). It uses HTTP and XML to exchange information and specifies how to
encode HTTP headers and XML files so that applications can talk to each other.
One great advantage to this is also a great detriment, security-wise: because HTTP
is generally allowed through most firewalls, applications using SOAP can generally
communicate at will throughout networks.
SOAP injection attacks allow you to inject malicious query strings (much like SQL
injection, as a matter of fact) that might give you the means to bypass authentication
and access databases behind the scenes. SOAP is compatible with HTTP and SMTP,

A. Cross-site scripting
B. Cross-site request forgery
C. Connection string parameter pollution
D. Phishing","The correct answer is A.
 XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a
web browser without proper validation or escaping. The basics of this attack revolve
around website design (or web application design on that site), dynamic content,
and invalidated input data. Usually when a web form pops up, the user inputs
something, and then some script dynamically changes the appearance or behavior
of the website based on what has been entered. XSS occurs when the bad guys take
advantage of that scripting (Java, for instance) and have it perform something other
than the intended response. For example, suppose instead of entering what you�re
supposed to enter in a form field, you enter an actual script. The server then does
what it�s supposed to�it processes the code sent from an authorized user. The best
defense against this is proper design and good input validation before the app ever
sees production in the first place."

this context.",,,"Which of the following is a common SOA vulnerability?
A. SQL injection
B. XSS
C. XML denial of service
D. CGI manipulation","The correct answer is C.
 Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a software design idea that is based on
specific pieces of software providing functionality as services between applications.
The idea is to define how two applications can interact so that one can perform a
piece of work for the other (or, better said, on behalf of the other). Each interaction
is independent of any other and is self-contained. SOA programmers make extensive
use of XML to carry all this out, and that leaves the application vulnerable to crafty
XML tampering. If an attacker can somehow pass an XML message with a large
payload, or any of a number of other bad content, they can perform an XML denialof-service attack on an SOA application. This isn�t to imply it�s the only type of DoS
available or that SOA is uniquely vulnerable (for instance, the only thing a specifically
crafted XML attack can affect). It�s just a question, so don�t read too much into it."

cookie is a small text-based file used to provide a more consistent web experience for
a web visitor. Because it holds various information, though, it can be manipulated for
nefarious purposes (using the Firefox add-on Cookie Editor, for instance).","The source code of software used by your client seems to have a large number of
gets() alongside sparsely used fgets(). What kind of attack is this software potentially
susceptible to?
A. SQL injection
B. Buffer overflow
C. Parameter tampering
D. Cookie manipulation","The correct answer is B.
 A buffer overflow is an attempt to write more data into an application�s prebuilt
buffer area in order to overwrite adjacent memory, execute code, or crash a system
(application). By inputting more data than the buffer is allocated to hold, you may
be able to crash the application or machine or alter the application�s data pointers.
gets() is a common source of buffer overflow vulnerabilities because it reads a line
from standard input into a buffer until a terminating EOF is found. It performs no
check for buffer overrun and has been largely replaced by fgets(). Also, technically
speaking, there is oftentimes no length to check for�it just writes until it reaches a
termination point."

anything to mitigate XSS.","Which of the following would be the best choice in the prevention of XSS?
A. Challenge tokens
B. Memory use controls
C. HttpOnly flag in cookies
D. Removing hidden form fields","The correct answer is C.
 In addition to input validation controls (always good for bunches of vulnerability
mitigations), setting the HttpOnly flag in cookies can be used in mitigation against some
XSS attacks. Cross-site scripting occurs when an attacker interjects code into a web page
form field that does not have appropriate input validation configured. The HttpOnly
cookie flag can stop any injected code from being accessible by a client-side script.
Per OWASP, if the HttpOnly flag is included in the HTTP response header, the
cookie cannot be accessed through client-side script. As a result, even if a cross-site
scripting flaw exists, and a user accidentally accesses a link that exploits this flaw, the
browser (primarily Internet Explorer) will not reveal the cookie to a third party."

 Questions on Metasploit can be very generalized or�like this question�pretty
darn specific. MSFconsole, opened with the msfconsole command, is a common
method of interfacing with Metasploit. As put by Offensive Security, it provides an
�all-in-one� centralized console and allows you efficient access to virtually all of
the options available in the MSF, and it�s the only supported way to access most
of the features within Metasploit. Commands used in the interface are listed and
discussed pretty well on Offensive Security�s site (https://www.offensive-security.com/
metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole-commands/). The connect command acts like a
miniature netcat clone, supporting SSL, proxies, pivoting, and file sends. By issuing
the connect command with an IP address and port number, you can connect to a
remote host from within MSFconsole the same as you would with netcat or telnet.
In addition to MSFconsole, you should also know that the Metasploit architecture
holds five modules: Exploits, Payloads, Encoders, NOPS, and Auxiliary. Exploits
is the basic module, used to encapsulate (and configure behaviors for) an exploit.
Payloads establishes a communication channel between Metasploit and the target.
Auxiliary is used to run things like port scanning and fuzzing."

command in the background might read something like this:
SELECT OrderID, FirstName, Lastname FROM Orders
In SQL, a single quote is used to indicate an upcoming character string. Once SQL
sees that open quote, it starts parsing everything after it as string input. If there�s
no close quote, an error occurs because SQL doesn�t know what to do with the
submitted characters. If the web page is configured poorly, that error will return to
you and let you know it�s time to start injecting SQL commands."

run essentially arbitrary commands on your system with the permissions of the web
server user and because they are almost always wrapped so that a script will execute
as the owner of the script, they can be extremely dangerous if not carefully checked.

 Blind SQL injection is really kinda neat, even if you�re not a nerd. Sometimes a

info you want, you start asking it (the SQL database) a lot of true-or-false questions.

hold passwords�and because most people use the same password on multiple sites,
this can be a gold mine for the attacker. In this scenario, the cookie is being replayedby an attacker to gain access. If a single key is used in encryption, a replay attack is
possible, because cookie authentication is carried out at the Application layer. It is
for this reason some organizations require browsers to automatically delete cookies

web server.","D is incorrect because POST does not include the form data in the URI request.
According to the World Wide Web Consortium (www.w3.org/), HTML
specifications define the difference between GET and POST. GET means that form
data will be encoded by a browser into a URL, whereas POST means the form data
is to appear within the message body. In short, a GET can be used for basic, simple
retrieval of data, and a POST should be used for most everything else (such as sending
an e-mail, updating data on a database, and ordering an item).","HTML forms include several methods for transferring data back and forth. Inside a form,
which of the following encodes the input into the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)?
A. HEAD
B. PUT
C. GET
D. POST","The correct answer is C.
 An HTTP GET is a method for returning data from a form that �encodes� the
form data to the end of the URI (a character string that identifies a resource on the
web, such as a page of text, a video clip, an image, or an application). For example, if
you were to enter a credit card number in a form using GET, the resulting URL might
look something like https://somesite.com/creditcard.asp?c#=4013229567852219,
where the long number is obviously a credit card number just sitting there waiting for
anyone to use.
Generally speaking, a POST is �more secure� than a GET, although they both have
their uses. If you�re wondering when a GET should be used as opposed to a POST,
the answer has to do with a vocabulary lesson: defining the term idempotent. Thrown
about with HTTP GET, idempotent is a mathematical concept about an operation
property: if the operation can be performed without changing results, even if it
is run multiple times, it�s considered idempotent. Therefore, if the input return
is assured of having no lasting effect on the state of the form in total, then using
a GET is perfectly reasonable. Also, a GET can usually transfer only up to 8KB,
whereas a POST can usually handle up to 2GB.
 However, keep in mind it may wind
up including sensitive information in that URI. Suppose your form returns a credit
card number and a bad guy is logging URIs: if HTTP GET is in place, the attacker
may be able to derive the information. In short, users can manipulate both GET
and POST, but GET is simply more visible because of its reliance on something that
browsers render to the screen in an editable field. A POST is meant for pushing data
directly, and a GET is used when the server is expected to pull something from the
data submitted in the URL."

A. SSH brute force
B. CSRF

 I would bet very large sums of cash you will see Shellshock on your exam�maybe
even a couple of times. Shellshock (also known as Bashdoor) exploits a feature in the
bash shell designed to allow environmental variable setting configuration. Basically,
someone was playing around in bash back in 2014 and figured out they could
add arbitrary commands to environmental variable configuration command-line
submissions. If an attacker input something like
env val='() [ :;}; echo BADCOMMAND' bash -c ""echo REALCOMMAND""
on a vulnerable system, BADCOMMAND would be executed before the real command.
Per Symantec (www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/shellshock-all-you-need-knowabout-bash-bug-vulnerability), �The most likely route of attack is through Web
servers utilizing CGI (Common Gateway Interface), the widely used system for
generating dynamic Web content. An attacker can potentially use CGI to send a
malformed environment variable to a vulnerable Web server. Because the server uses
Bash to interpret the variable, it will also run any malicious command tacked on to
it.� Other avenues for Shellshock exploitation include the following:
� OpenSSH The �force command� function (where a fixed command is run
when a user logs on, even if the user requested a different command) can be
exploited in Shellshock.
� DHCP Some DHCP clients have the capability of passing commands to the
bash shell�for example, during connection to a Wi-Fi network. This can be
exploited in Shellshock.
� Qmail If bash is used to process e-mail messaging, the server processes external
input in a way that can be exploited in bash."

C. The Googlebot crawler is allowed to index pages starting with /tmp/.
D. The Googlebot crawler can access and index everything on the site except for pages
starting with /tmp/.","The correct answer is D.
 The robots.txt file was created to allow web designers to control index access to
their sites. There are a couple of things you need to know about this file�for your
exam and the real world. The first is, no matter what the robots.txt file says, attackers
using a crawler to index your site are going to ignore it anyway: it�s valid only for
�good-guy� crawlers. After that, the rest is easy: robots.txt is stored on the root, is
available to anyone (by design), and is read in order from top to bottom, much like
an ACL on a router. The format is simple: define the crawler (User-agent :name_
of_crawler), and then define what it does not have access to. Most robot.txt files will
make use of the * variable to signify all crawlers, but you can certainly get specific
with who is allowed in and what they can see.
In this example, from top to bottom, the Googlebot crawler is defined and restricted
from seeing /tmp/ pages�no other restrictions are listed. After that, all other crawlers
(User-agent: *) are restricted from seeing any page (Disallow: /). The last two lines
are truly irrelevant because the condition to ignore all pages has been read.
For additional information here, if you think about what a robots.txt file does, you
could consider it a pointer to pages you, as an attacker, really want to see. After all,
if the security person on the site didn�t want Google indexing it, useful information
probably resides there. On the flip side, a security-minded person may get a little
snippy with robots.txt and have a little fun, sending you to some truly terrible
Internet locations should you try to access one of the pages listed there."

"B,C","B,C","A is incorrect because WEP uses a 24-bit IV. In WEP, this meant there were
approximately 16 million unique IV values. Although this may seem like a large
number, it�s really not�a determined hacker can capture enough IVs in a brute-force
attack in a matter of hours to crack the key.",D is incorrect because there is no such thing as WEP2,,"Which of the following use a 48-bit initialization vector? (Choose all that apply.)
A. WEP
B. WPA
C. WPA2
D. WEP2","The correct answer is B, C.
 One of the improvements from WEP to WPA involved extending the
initialization vector (IV) to 48 bits from 24 bits. While this may seem like a simple
doubling of options, you�ve got to remember each additional bit exponentially
increases the keyspace. An IV provides for confidentiality and integrity. Wireless
encryption algorithms use it to calculate an integrity check value (ICV), appending it
to the end of the data payload. The IV is then combined with a key to be input into
an algorithm (RC4 for WEP, AES for WPA2). Therefore, because the length of an IV
determines the total number of potential random values that can possibly be created
for encryption purposes, doubling to 48 bits increased overall security. By itself, this
didn�t answer all security problems�it only meant it took a little longer to capture
enough IV packets to crack the code. However, combined with other steps, it did
provide for better security."
"B,D","B,D","A is incorrect because WEP does not use TKIP. In addition to the same key being

 WEP uses a 24-bit initialization vector and RC4 to �encrypt� data
transmissions, although saying that makes me shake in disgust because it�s really a
misnomer. WEP was designed as basic encryption merely to simulate the �security�
of being on a wired network�hence, the �Equivalent� part in Wired Equivalent
Privacy. It was never intended as true encryption protection. WPA was an
improvement on two fronts. First, the shared key portion of encryption was greatly
enhanced by the use of Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). In short, the key
used to encrypt data was made temporary in nature and is swapped out every 10,000
packets or so. Additionally, WPA2 uses NIST-approved encryption with AES as the
algorithm of choice."

 Of the choices provided, the access control list is the only one that makes sense.
This is what exactly what an access control list is designed for: by making sure only
devices that are authorized can connect, you ensure unauthorized devices cannot
connect (or at least take steps to avoid their connection). As a side note here, be
careful not to confuse a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) with the ACL.
A WIPS will monitor your traffic and, just like the better-known network intrusion
prevention system, will take steps to prevent intrusion based on traffic analysis,
thresholds, and alerts. Lastly, on questions like this, the process of elimination can
help you discern the answer pretty easily."

B,B,"A is incorrect because the response to a deauth packet does not contain the WEP
access code in the clear. If it did, the attacker wouldn�t need to bother with all this

of the AP. It�s usually easy enough to gain from any number of methods (using
airodump, for instance) and isn�t a reason for sending multiple deauth packets. There
are networks where the BSSID is hidden (referred to as cloaking), but other tools
(airmon and airodump) can help with that.","D is incorrect because even if an SSID is �cloaked,� that doesn�t mean it�s actually
hidden; all it means is that it is not broadcast. The SSID is still contained in every
single packet sent from the AP, and discovering it is easy enough.","An attacker is attempting to crack a WEP code to gain access to the network. After

What is she trying to accomplish?
A. To gain access to the WEP access code by examining the response to deauthentication
packets, which contain the WEP code
B. To use deauthentication packets to generate lots of network traffic
C. To determine the BSSID of the access point
D. To discover the cloaked SSID of the network","The correct answer is B.
 Within 802.11 standards, there are several different management-type frames in
use: everything from a beacon and association request to a probe request. One of
these management frames is a deauthentication packet, which basically shuts off a
client from the network. The client then has to reconnect�and will do so quickly.
The idea behind this kind of activity is to generate lots of traffic to capture in order
to discern the WEP access code (from clients trying to reassociate to all the new ARP
packets that will come flying around, since many machines will dump their ARP
cache after being shut off the network). Remember that the initialization vectors
within WEP are relatively short (24 bits) and are reused frequently, so any attempt to
crack the code requires, in general, around 15,000 or so packets. You can certainly
gather these over time, but generating traffic can accomplish it much faster. One
final note on this must be brought up: this type of attack can just as easily result in a
denial-of-service attack against hosts and the AP in question, so be careful."
C,C,"A is incorrect because 802.11a operates at 54Mbps but uses the 5GHz frequency
range. The big drawback to 802.11a was the frequency range itself�because of the
higher frequency, the network range was limited. Whereas 802.11b clients could
be spread across a relative large distance, 802.11a clients could communicate much
faster but had to be closer together. Combined with the increased cost of equipment,
this contributed to 802.11a not being fully accepted as a de facto standard. That
said, for security purposes, it may not be a bad choice. Not as many people use it, or
even look for it, and its smaller range may work to assist you in preventing spillage
outside your building. Lastly, it�s not necessarily the higher frequency itself that causes
the distance limitation; instead, it�s how common building materials and propagation
issues interact with it. It�s overly complicated, but if you are of a mind to do so and
have some time to kill, you�ll find this topic fascinating to read about.","B is incorrect because 802.11b operates at 11Mbps on the 2.4GHz frequency range.
It�s slower than �a� and �g,� but soon after its release it became the de facto standard

5 GHz. It achieves this rate using multiple in, multiple out (MIMO) antennas.","Which wireless standard works at 54Mbps on a frequency range of 2.4GHz?
A. 802.11a
B. 802.11b
C. 802.11g
D. 802.11n","The correct answer is C.
 The 802.11 series of standards identifies a variety of wireless issues, such as the
order imposed on how clients communicate, rules for authentication, data transfer,
size of packets, how the messages are encoded into the signal, and so on. 802.11g
combines the advantages of both the �a� and �b� standards without as many of the
drawbacks. It�s fast (at 54Mbps), is backward compatible with 802.11b clients,
and doesn�t suffer from the coverage area restrictions 802.11a has to contend with.
Considering it operates in the 2.4GHz range, however, there may be some interference
issues to deal with. Not only is a plethora of competing networks blasting their signals
(sometimes on the same channel) near and around your network, but you also have to
consider Bluetooth devices, cordless phones, and even baby monitors that may cause
disruption (due to interference) of wireless signals. Also, microwave ovens happen to
run at 2.45GHz�right smack dab in the middle of the range."

 Rogue access points (sometimes called evil twin attacks) can provide an easy
way to gain useful information from clueless users on a target network. However,
be forewarned: security personnel can use multiple tools and techniques to discover
rogue APs. NetStumbler is one of the more popular, and useful, tools available. It�s
a great network discovery tool that can also be used to identify rogue access points,
network interference, and signal strength. Kismet, another popular tool, provides
many of the same features and is noted as a �passive� network discovery tool.
NetSurveyor is a free, easy-to-use Windows-based tool that provides many of the
same features as NetStumbler and Kismet and works with virtually every wireless
NIC in modern existence. A �professional� version of NetSurveyor is now available
(you get ten uses of it before you�re required to buy a license). Lastly, identifying a
rogue access point requires the security staff to have knowledge of every access point
owned�and its MAC.
 If it�s known there are ten APs in the network and suddenly
an 11th appears, that alone won�t help find and disable the bad one. It takes some
level of organization to find these things, and that plays into your hands as an ethical
hacker. The longer your evil twin is left sitting there, the better chance it will be

it is this: the message is encrypted with a block cipher, and the encryption of each
block in the chain is dependent on the encryption value of the block in front of it. In
other words, if block 2 is altered in any way, then decryption of blocks 3, 4, and so
on, becomes impossible. One final note on CCMP for your study and memorization:
CCMP is based on AES processing and uses a 128-bit key and a 128-bit block size,
and ECC sometimes refers to it as AES-CCMP."

A. Port security is enabled on the access point.
B. The SSID is cloaked from the access point.
C. MAC filtering is enabled on the access point.
D. Weak signaling is frustrating connectivity to the access point.","The correct answer is C.
 The sequence of the preceding commands has the attacker bringing the wireless
interface down, changing its hardware address, and then bringing it back up. The
most likely reason for this is MAC filtering is enabled on the AP, which is restricting
access to only those machines the administrator wants connecting to the wireless
network. The easy way around this is to watch traffic and copy one of the MAC
addresses. With a quick spoof on your own hardware, you�re connected. As an aside,
MAC spoofing isn�t just for the wireless world. The command would be slightly
different (wlan0 refers to a wireless NIC; eth0 would be an example of a wired port),

 Of the choices provided, the wireless intrusion prevention system is the best choice.
A WIPS is a network device that, among other things, monitors wireless traffic for the
presence of unauthorized access points and then takes countermeasures against them."
D,D,"A is incorrect because a rogue AP is simply an AP set up for you to unknowingly

address of a system that is allowed on the network (APs can use MAC filtering to allow
only specific devices to connect).","C is incorrect because an aLTEr attack focuses on LTE (Long-Term Evolution, aka
�4G�) devices. An aLTEr attacker basically sets up their own cellular signal device

It�s important to note for your study that the attacker would need some very significant
hardware on hand and would need to be relatively close to the target for anything
to work.","Charity visits a client business she has worked with multiple times. When she opens her
laptop, her wireless connection attempts to automatically connect to the network, named
BUSINESS1. Unbeknownst to her, an attacker has set up a cloned network with the
same details. As her connection begins, he sends and continues to resend the third step of
connection handshake. After many iterations of this, the attacker gains enough decrypted
details to crack the encryption key. Which of the following best describes this attack?
A. Rogue AP
B. AP MAC spoofing
C. aLTEr
D. KRACK","The correct answer is D.
 Of the choices provided, KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) comes the closest
to fitting the bill. First, you should know that KRACK is largely defunct as an attack
nowadays�most modern systems protect against it, and it won�t work. However,
you�ll no doubt see a question about it, so let�s dive in.
KRACK works by exploiting the four-way handshake all WPA2 wireless networks
take part in. During this exchange, the wireless systems blasts out something called
an ANonce (a one-time, randomly generated number, more or less). The client receives it,
runs some calculation of its own, and responds with another randomly generated
SNonce. If everything looks okay, the wireless system sends the GTK (Group Temporal
Key), which is the encryption key the WPA2 system uses for broadcast and multicast
messages. If everything looks right the client connects, you�re off and running.
In a KRACK attack, the cloned system run by the bad guy keeps resending the third
part of the handshake to the client. Each time the client accepts the connection
request, a small piece of data is decrypted and, over several iterations, the encryption
key is cracked.
One last thing�KRACK needs proximity to work. In other words, assuming we go
back in time before OS patches were created to prevent the attack, you�d have to be
close to your target to set things up. There�s only so much reach a wireless system has,
and you�d have to be inside that range to even attempt KRACK."
C,C,"A, B, and D are incorrect because these are all good ideas regarding mobile device use

B. Whitelist applications and ensure all employees are educated about and made aware
of them.
C. Allow jailbroken and rooted devices on the network, as long as employees have signed
the policy.
D. Implement MDM.","The correct answer is C.
 Bring your own device (BYOD) and mobile device management (MDM) are
becoming more and more of a headache for security administrators. BYOD is the
idea that employees can bring their own smartphones, tablets, and mobile devices
to the workplace and use them as part of the enterprise network. Mobile device
management (often implemented with the use of a third-party product containing
management features for mobile device vendors) is an effort to administrate and
secure mobile device use within the organization.
Obviously, having mobile devices roaming in and out of a network can cause a variety
of security issues, and lots of commonsense steps can be taken to address this. Allowing
rooted and jailbroken devices�essentially devices that could have any number of
installed (knowingly or not) issues on them�is not among the good steps to take."

 I don�t own an iPhone, iPod, or iAnything, and have no desire to. However, since
iOS is one of the most popular mobile device operating systems, I have to have at
least some working knowledge of it. And you do, too, if you want to be a CEH.
Jailbreaking an iPhone is the process of removing the software restrictions imposed
by Apple so you can install a modified set of kernel patches, thereby allowing you to
run whatever software or updates you want. EC-Council lists three main methods of
jailbreaking, two of which (iBoot and Bootrom) allow something called iBoot access.
iBoot access basically refers to the ability to affect the firmware itself.
Userland is a term referring to the software running on the iOS device after the
kernel has loaded. Therefore, a userland jailbreak, being entirely software based, can
be patched by Apple after the effort. Userland jailbreaks include JailbreakMe Star,
Saffron, Spirit, Absinthe, evasi0n, and Pangu."

D. App sandboxing","The correct answer is B.
 Smishing is the term given to a mobile device attack whereby an attacker sends an

Grab a model number and use the city: filter. How about IIS servers on a specific
subnet? Try iis net:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/yy (where the x�s are your subnet and yy is your
CIDR notation). If you want to get really specific on your location, you can use the
geo: filter, along with latitude and longitude coordinates. The Shodan geo: filter
actually accepts between two and four coordinate parameters. The example used two,
showing a latitude/longitude pair. If the example used three coordinates, they would
represent latitude, longitude, and range. Add a fourth coordinate, and you create
a geographic box to search in: top-left latitude, top-left longitude, bottom-right

B,B,"A, C, and D are all incorrect for the same reason�they�re not the most popular
communication technology for IoT devices according to CEH material. But I
thought I�d include some information on each of them for your study purposes, in

RFID is probably the most familiar to everyone, as it has been around and in the
public eye longer than most everything else. I mean, who hasn�t heard of an RFIDblocking wallet? QR codes are those scannable, readable tags that hold information
about a device, product, or item. If you�ve flown anywhere lately, I�m sure you�ve seen
folks using their phone as their boarding pass, scanning the QR code to go sit in a
metal tube as soon as possible.
LiFi is possibly the weirdest item on this list, and one I had honestly never heard
of until prepping for this edition. LiFi is sort of like Wi-Fi in the same sense that a
Lamborghini is like a Chevy Uplander minivan. Sure, packets are encoded and used
much the same way, but LiFi uses light from LED bulbs to get it done. Because it
uses light, speeds are incredible�up to 224 Gbps�and the interference you deal
with in wireless signal communications is nonexistent, but for now it�s simply in its
infancy. That said, invest in LED bulbs for your home soon�LiFi may be your next

 IoT devices make use of many wireless communications technologies, and some of
them have fairly weird names. Zigbee is, according to EC-Council, the world�s most
popular IoT device communication technology. As a result, you should know that

B,B,"A, C, and D are all incorrect for the same reason�these layers provide different
services than what is being asked about. The Edge Technology layer holds technologies
like RFID tags and other readers that monitor, sense, and report on the environment.
The main function of this layer is data collection and connection of devices within the network. The Internet layer is probably the one that tripped you up here, but
there�s a very good explanation�or at least an explanation. The question is asking
about IoT architecture, not what you know to be real-world networking. In IoT
architecture, the Internet layer is referred to as the crucial one, serving as the main
component carrying out communication in each of the IoT data models. Lastly,

 IoT communication models seem pretty straightforward, but there are some
weird one-off comparisons here and there. In this case, the smartphone�more
appropriately, the app on the smartphone used by the owner�acts as the gateway,

 There are few certainties in life�the rising and setting of the sun every day,
lovebugs making life miserable for a couple months each year in the South, and
ever-increasing taxes on everything from income to gas. One you can add to your
list is HackRF One being on your CEH exam. This handy little piece of hardware
exploded onto the scene in a Kickstarter campaign in 2014. Its creator, Michael
Ossmann, called it Project Jawbone back then, and its open source nature attracted a
lot of attention. On the good side, information security folks saw a great tool to help
in testing their wireless offerings. On the bad side, hackers immediately saw a quickand-easy way to jam, disrupt, and hack IoT devices everywhere.
For the just under $300, you too can own a HackRF One device (https://
greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/). According to the website, HackRF One was
�designed to enable test and development of modern and next generation radio
technologies...and is an open source hardware platform that can be used as a USB
peripheral or programmed for stand-alone operation.� What�s really interesting (and quite humorous to me), however, is the very next statement: �HackRF One is test
equipment for RF systems. It has not been tested for compliance with regulations
governing transmission of radio signals. You are responsible for using your HackRF
One legally.�
HackRF One is capable of receiving and transmitting on a frequency range of 1 MHz
to 6 GHz, and it transmits and receives half-duplex. It has become a valuable and
prized hacking tool due to its ease of use. Just be careful, though. Remember, you are
responsible for its legal use."
A,A,"B, C, and D are all incorrect. IIOT (IT/OT Convergence) refers to the integration

within industrial control system (ICS) networks?
A. Purdue model
B. IIOT
C. SCADA
D. PLC","The correct answer is A.
 The Purdue model, formerly called PERA (Purdue Enterprise Refence
Architecture), is simply a structural model for industrial control system (ICS)
networks that defines six distinct layers�with defined components and relevant
security controls for each.
Developed in the 1990s by the Purdue University Consortium for computerintegrated manufacturing, it was adopted by ISA-99 and shows the connections and
dependencies of main components within a typical ICS.
The model splits ICS architecture into two zones (OT and IT), divided by a DMZ.
Each zone is further divided by levels relevant to specific component and function:
� Level 0 is the assets that send information to the programmable logic controllers
(PLCs), such as sensors, pumps, valves, and motors. Multiple types exist within
each (passive or active, analog or digital, and so on).
� Level 1 includes the PLCs, remote terminal units (RTUs), and intelligent
electronic devices (IEDs). These are the assets that monitor Level 1 and send
commands to the assets.
� Level 2 contains human-machine interfaces (HMIs) and SCADA software. These
monitor and manage overall processes within the system.
� Level 3 holds all the systems that provide information on management of
production workflows.
� Level 4 includes enterprise resource planning (ERP) software and other systems
for managing operations logistics.
� Level 5 is the enterprise network itself."

study materials and will be key to your success. Separation of duties is a provision
of all cloud computing types, but only one of the three takes care of everything. In
Software as a Service (SaaS), the service provider delivers the entirety of the span of
responsibility. Everything from applications and data through middleware and OS,
all the way down to the networking itself, is provided by the service provisioner. For
comparison sake, in Platform as a Service (PaaS), the service provider takes care of
everything except the applications and data. In Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), the

 This scenario is tailor-made for Platform as a Service (PaaS). Despite also being a
name brand recognized mostly during Easter for coloring eggs, PaaS is geared toward
software development, as it provides a platform that allows subscribers to create
applications without building the infrastructure it would normally take to develop
and launch software. Hardware and software are hosted by the provider on its own
infrastructure, so customers do not have to install or build homegrown hardware and

 There are three types of cloud computing implementation: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
In the case of Amazon EC2, Infrastructure as a Service best matches the description.
IaaS basically provides virtualized computing resources over the Internet. A thirdparty provider hosts infrastructure components, applications, and services on behalf
of its subscribers, with a hypervisor (such as VMware, Oracle VirtualBox, Xen, or
KVM) running the virtual machines as guests. Collections of hypervisors within the
cloud provider exponentially increase the virtualized resources available and provide
scalability of service to subscribers. As a result, IaaS is a good choice, not just for
day-to-day infrastructure service, but also for temporary or experimental workloads
that may change unexpectedly. IaaS subscribers typically pay on a per-use basis
(within a certain timeframe, for instance) or sometimes by the amount of virtual
machine space used."

D. Multiple containers require multiple operating systems on the host device.
E. Containers and virtual machines are the same thing.","The correct answer is A, C.
 I can virtually guarantee you�ll see comparisons of containers and virtual
machines on your exam, and because the wording in their definitions is so close,
it�s easy to get them confused. The main difference to keep in mind between the
two is that containers share the OS of the system they�re on, whereas VMs are their
own separate entities with their own OSs. Virtually speaking, think of a container
as a package and a VM as a complete system. A container holds all the components
necessary for an application to run, and it relies on the underlying OS to host. A VM
is a complete virtual system, with its own operating system."

D. Session riding","The correct answer is A.
 Attacks aren�t necessarily specific to cloud computing, but EC-Council covers
wrapping attacks here, so we�ll follow suit. In a wrapping attack, the user sends a
request to the server, but the SOAP response is intercepted by the attacker. He then
duplicates the original message and sends it as if he is the user. In short, to pull this
off, you just intercept the response, change the data in the SOAP envelope, and

application components provide services to other components via a communications
protocol, typically over a network?
A. API
B. SOA

 In service-oriented architecture (SOA), software is designed where each of the
individual components works and communicates with components on different
systems across the network. Each computer can run any of the services in the
software, and each individual component is built so that it can exchange information
with any other service in the network, without interaction or the need to make
changes to the software. For example, someone might create an API that provides
access to a database, which then allows third-party vendors to create their own
applications to take advantage of it."

 Some of you may actually work with and in a cloud, and you may disagree with at

the real world and your CEH exam, for your test you really need to know the benefits of
virtualization. The idea itself is great�run one or more operating systems simultaneously
on the same physical box by virtualizing the hardware to each OS. Multiple companies
(such as VMware, Oracle VirtualBox, and Xen) provide the hypervisor (aka virtual
machine monitor, or VMM, which is an application or hardware that creates and
runs virtual machines) that allows multiple OSs to share the same physical machine
hardware. Virtualizing your server can improve operational efficiency, provide for more
efficient backups, offer disaster recovery and data protection, and reduce administrative
work. Additionally, virtualization may have a positive effect on ensuring control and
compliance throughout the network, as well as reduce overall costs."

 One of the biggest misconceptions about cloud computing seems to be where
the lines of responsibility are drawn. However, it should come as no surprise that
security is everyone�s responsibility, and that absolutely extends to the cloud. The
provider must protect the hardware, virtualization, VMs, and network connectivity.
The consumer must protect their virtual systems (OSs, applications, and data).
Sometimes this is a challenge in the real world. Where does your testing start and
end? If your entire system relies on a cloud provider to remain up and secure, can you
test all of it? And what happens if your resources are comingled somewhere inside all
that cloud secret sauce? Can you really trust they�re on top of things, security-wise?
Should you? Can you? And lastly, remember that whatever issues you had before
migrating to the cloud won�t magically disappear once you�ve migrated. In effect,

 The side-channel attack, also known as a cross-guest VM breach, occurs when
an attacker gets a virtual machine on the same host as the target. Through a variety
of means for taking advantage of vulnerabilities in some shared technologies, the
attacker then uses the shared physical resources to pilfer data. Providers can mitigate
these attacks by using an up-to-date hypervisor provision, implementing strong
virtual firewalls between guest OSs, and enforcing the use of encryption. Subscribers
can help by locking down (hardening) their OSs and using good coding in their
applications (especially when it comes to accessing resources such as memory). As a

describes this infection?
A. Spyware
B. Ransomware
C. Trojan
D. Adware","The correct answer is B.
 The name ransomware gives away its purpose: the malware infects your system
and then restricts access to your files and folders, demanding a ransom payment
to get control back. ECC lists five different ransomware families: Cryptorbit,
Cryptolocker, Cryptodefense, Cryptowall, and police-themed. Usually the online
payment involves bitcoin, but it can take other avenues. In any case, never pay off the
attacker�you�re only signing yourself up for future terror. Cleaning off ransomware
may involve booting into Safe Mode, or even using a system restore on Windows
systems. You may even get away with an external AV scan as a fix action, but be sure
to scrub the system for hidden files and folders the ransomware may have left behind.
Lastly, I can�t overstate enough the value of good, solid, dependable backups. Even if
you�re foolish enough to pay the ransom, there is no guarantee any of your files will
remain accessible after the �unlock��and could you trust them anyway? Invest in
good backups and run them religiously."

A. Static
B. Dynamic
C. File fingerprinting
D. Code emulation","The correct answer is A.
 EC-Council defines two main types of malware analysis�static and dynamic.
In static analysis, the examiner never actually installs or executes the malware. It�s
considered a �safe� analysis, as the suspect file isn�t installed or allowed to execute;
however, as this is obviously a touchy area, it�s always a best and recommended
practice to perform analysis in a closed environment. This is largely a manual process,
but there are static analysis tools that can assist."
C,C,A is incorrect because cross-site scripting is a web application attack.,"B is incorrect because session splicing is an IDS evasion method. The attacker delivers

ISN determination.","Pen test team member Amy attempts to guess the ISN for a TCP session. Which attack is
she most likely carrying out?
A. XSS
B. Session splicing
C. Session hijacking
D. Multipartite attack","The correct answer is C.
 The idea behind session hijacking is fairly simple: the attacker waits for a session to
begin and, after all the pesky authentication gets done, jumps in to steal the session for
herself. In practice, it�s a little harder and more complicated than that, but the key to the
whole attack is in determining the initial sequence number (ISN) used for the session. The
ISN is sent by the initiator of the session in the first step (SYN). This is acknowledged in
the second step of the handshake (SYN/ACK) by incrementing that ISN by 1, and then
another ISN is generated by the recipient. This second number is acknowledged by the
initiator in the third step (ACK), and from there on out communication can occur. Per
EC-Council, the following steps describe the session hijack:
1. Sniff the traffic between the client and the server.
2. Monitor the traffic and predict the sequence numbering.
3. Desynchronize the session with the client.
4. Predict the session token and take over the session.
5. Inject packets to the target server.
For what it�s worth, pulling this attack off via EC-Council�s take on the whole matter
requires you to do some fairly significant traffic sniffing. And if you�re already positioned
to sniff the traffic in the first place, wouldn�t the whole scenario possibly be a moot point?
You need to know it for the exam, but real-world application may be rare."

 A packer uses compression to pack the malware executable into a smaller size.
Not only does this reduce the file size, but it serves to make the malware harder to
detect for some antivirus engines. While it can be compared to a ZIP file, there are
differences. For one example, the extraction occurs in memory and not on the disk.
But the primary difference between a packer and a general compression routine like
.zip is that a packer inflates/restores at runtime and on binary files (versus the more
generic compression offered by .zip)."

access to your network and remains undetected for a long time period?
A. Fileless malware
B. Zombie
C. Fraggle
D. APT","The correct answer is D.
 NIST defines advanced persistent threat (APT) this way: �An adversary with
sophisticated levels of expertise and significant resources, allowing it through the
use of multiple different attack vectors (e.g., cyber, physical, and deception) to
generate opportunities to achieve its objectives, which are typically to establish and
extend footholds within the information technology infrastructure of organizations for
purposes of continually exfiltrating information and/or to undermine or impede critical
aspects of a mission, program, or organization, or place itself in a position to do so in
the future; moreover, the advanced persistent threat pursues its objectives repeatedly
over an extended period of time, adapting to a defender�s efforts to resist it, and with
determination to maintain the level of interaction needed to execute its objectives.�
I don�t know about you, but that wall of text reminds me of the agreement contract
you have to accept before using your iPhone.
What this really means is APTs are bad guys (oftentimes well-funded, nation-state
attackers) who have found a way into your systems and have stayed around for a
long time. APTs are a nightmare from an incident response (IR) position, as tracking
down the initial attack vector, how long they�ve been around, and how much they�ve
had access to is next to impossible."

 Most have heard of session hijacking and man in the middle, but what about man
in the browser? A man-in-the-browser (MITB) attack occurs when the hacker sends
a Trojan to intercept browser calls. The Trojan basically sits between the browser and
libraries, allowing a hacker to watch, and interact within, a browser session. Cobalt

have his Beacon (the name of his implant) on a box, you can �browser pivot� such
that all of the target�s active sessions become your own. All of them. It effectively
sets up a local proxy port so you can point your browser to it, and it directs all your
requests through the Beacon on the target machine. Now you�re browsing in your
own browser as the target, without them even knowing it."

C. Claire uses a system restore point to regain access to deleted files and folders.
D. Claire uses the organization�s backup application to restore files and folders.","The correct answer is A, C, D.
 Virus removal can be tricky, especially if nobody knows how and when
the virus got on the system in the first place. As a matter of fact, in many places I�ve
worked, discovering the source of the virus is as important as cleaning the system
in the first place. Cleaning a virus off the system usually involves scrubbing the
Microsoft registry, deleting files and folders (don�t forget to check for hidden ones),
and a host of other details and actions. Sometimes AV removal applications can help
with this process, but sometimes it�s an involved, manual process.
Even with tools to help in removal, administrators can�t afford to overlook system
restore points, backups, and user behavior. If a virus is on a system during a system
restore copy action, then any restoration of that point will reinstall the virus. The
same thing goes for data backups themselves�it should follow that an infected file
while being backed up will remain infected during the restore action. As for user
behavior, if the user is re-infected immediately following a specific website visit, or
after using a USB (or other removable media), at least you can pinpoint the source
and hopefully stop it from happening again."

A. Data Link layer
B. Transport layer

numbers, of course, and sequencing occurs at the Transport layer. Now, for all
you real-world folks out there screaming that communications can be, and truly
are, hijacked at every level, let me caution your outrage with something I�ve said
repeatedly throughout this book: sometimes the exam and reality are two different
things, and if you want to pass the test, you�ll need to memorize this the way
EC-Council wants you to. Session hijacking is taught in CEH circles as a measure of
guessing sequence numbers, and that�s a Transport layer entity. In the real world, your
Physical layer interception of a target would result in access to everything above, but

C,C,"A is incorrect because spoofing and hijacking are different. An argument can be made

C. Hijacking interrupts a client�s communication, whereas spoofing does not.
D. Hijacking emulates a foreign IP address, whereas spoofing refers to MAC addresses.","The correct answer is C.
 Hijacking and spoofing can sometimes be confused with each other, although they
really shouldn�t be. Spoofing refers to a process where the attacking machine pretends
to be something it is not. Whether by faking a MAC address or an IP address, the
idea is that other systems on the network will communicate with your machine
(that is, set up and tear down sessions) as if it�s the target system. Generally this is
used to benefit sniffing efforts. Hijacking is a totally different animal. In hijacking,
the attacker jumps into an already existing session, knocking the client out of it and
fooling the server into continuing the exchange. In many cases, the client will simply
reconnect to the server over a different session, with no one the wiser: the server isn�t
even aware of what happened, and the client simply connects again in a different
session. As an aside, EC-Council describes session hijacking as using these steps:
1. Sniff the traffic between the client and the server.

 As noted already, session hijacking requires the attacker to guess the proper
upcoming sequence number(s) to pull off the attack, pushing the original client out
of the session. Using unpredictable session IDs (or, better stated in the real world,
using a modern operating system with less predictable sequence numbers) in the first
place protects against this. Other countermeasures for session hijacking are fairly
common sense: use encryption to protect the channel, limit incoming connections,
minimize remote access, and regenerate the session key after authentication is
complete. And, lastly, don�t forget user education: if the users don�t know any better,
they might not think twice about clicking past the security certificate warning or
reconnecting after being suddenly shut down."

 Back when it was discovered in March 2014, Heartbleed was described as the
worst vulnerability found (at least in terms of its potential impact) since commercial
traffic began to flow on the Internet. Heartbleed exploits a small feature in OpenSSL
that turned out to present a very big problem. OpenSSL uses a heartbeat during an
open session to verify that data was received correctly, and it does this by �echoing�
data back to the other system. Basically, one system tells the other, �I received what
you sent and it�s all good. Go ahead and send more.� In Heartbleed, an attacker sends
a single byte of data while telling the server it sent 64KB of data. The server will then
send back 64KB of random data from its memory. Items such as usernames and
passwords, private keys (which is exceptionally troubling, since future communication
could be decrypted), cookies, and a host of other nifty bits of information could be
easily stolen."

D,D,"A is incorrect because, although a digital signature does provide a means for verifying
an identity (encryption with your private key, which can be decrypted only with your
corresponding public key, proves you are indeed you), it doesn�t provide any means
of sending keys anywhere. A digital signature is nothing more than an algorithmic
output that is designed to ensure the authenticity (and integrity) of the sender. You

B. Hash value
C. Private key
D. Digital certificate
E. Nonrepudiation","The correct answer is D.
 This one is actually easy, yet it is confusing to a lot of folks. You have to remember
the goal of this little portion of a PKI system�how does one know this public key
really belongs to User Joe and not User Mike, and how can it be delivered safely to
everyone? A digital certificate is the answer because it contains the sender�s public key
and can be used to identify the sender. Because the CA provides the certificate and
key (public), the user can be certain the public key actually belongs to the intended
recipient. This simplifies distribution of keys as well, because users can go to a central
authority�a key store, if you will�instead of directly to each user in the organization.

backward compatibility to SSL 3.0. Which vulnerability takes advantage of the degradation
of service down to SSL 3.0 in the TLS handshake?
A. Heartbleed
B. FREAK

D. POODLE","The correct answer is D.
 POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) was discovered
by Google�s security team and announced to the public on October 14, 2014. This
time it was a case of backward compatibility being a problem. Many browsers would
revert to SSL 3.0 when a TLS connection was unavailable, and because TLS performs
a handshake effort designed to degrade service until something acceptable (that is,
a degraded encryption both sides can use) is found, if a hacker could jump in the
connection between client and server, he could interfere with these handshakes,
making them all fail. This would result in the client dropping all the way to SSL 3.0.
SSL 3.0 has a design flaw that allows the padding data at the end of a block cipher to
be changed so that the encryption cipher becomes less secure each time it is passed.
If the same secret�let�s say a password�is sent over several sessions, more and more
information about it will leak. Eventually the connection may as well be plain text,

the inference without overthinking the question.","C is incorrect because chosen cipher text works almost exactly like a cipher-textonly attack. Statistical analysis without a plain-text version for comparison can be
performed, but it�s only for portions of gained cipher text. That�s the key word to

can use a user�s public key to encrypt plain text and then decrypt the result to find
patterns for exploitation).","D is incorrect because it�s irrelevant to this scenario. Replay attacks catch streams of

 There is definitely some room for argument on this question: Who�s to say all the

simple as hiding the message in the text of a written correspondence or as complex

protection does nothing. Assuming the user does power off the machine before taking
it on a trip, preboot protects everything�including the Master Boot Record�and
ensures that even if the laptop is stolen or lost, the data inside is protected. If the user
doesn�t power off, then DAR is just another security tool that provides the illusion of
security�which may be even worse than having nothing at all."
C,C,"A is incorrect because, although symmetric encryption does use the same key for

A. 7

D. 28","The correct answer is C.
 Symmetric encryption is really fast and works great with bulk encryption;

have 7(7 � 1)/2 = 21."

A. Symmetric encryption scales easily and provides for nonrepudiation.
B. Symmetric encryption does not scale easily and does not provide for nonrepudiation.
C. Symmetric encryption is not suited for bulk encryption.

 Symmetric encryption has always been known for strength and speed; however,
scalability and key exchange are big drawbacks. Additionally, there is no way
to provide for nonrepudiation (within the confines of the encryption system).
Symmetric encryption is good for a great many things when you don�t want all the

their own certificates and key exchange, and multiple entities sign certificates for one
another. In other words, users within this system trust each other based on certificates

top (which is known as the root CA), it makes use of one or more intermediate
CAs underneath it�known as RAs�to issue and manage certificates. This system
is the most secure because users can track the certificate back to the root to ensure
authenticity without a single point of failure.","The PKI system you are auditing has a certificate authority (CA) at the top that creates
and issues certificates. Users trust each other based on the C

D. Hierarchical trust","The correct answer is C.
 Trust models within PKI systems provide a standardized method for certificate

hierarchical. The single authority system has a CA at the top that creates and issues
certs. Users then trust each other based on the CA at the top vouching for them.

all, if it is compromised, your whole system is kaput."

A. The hash created for the digital signature holds 160 bits.
B. The hash created for the digital signature holds 2048 bits.
C. RSA is the hash algorithm used for the digital signature.
D. This certificate contains a private key.","The correct answer is A.
 Questions on the digital certificate are usually easy enough, and this is no
exception. The algorithm used to create the hash is clearly defined as Signature
Hash Algorithm (SHA-1), and, as we already know, SHA-1 creates a 160-bit hash
output. This will then be encrypted by the sender�s private key and decrypted on the
recipient�s end with the public key, thus verifying identity"

C. If the first value is 0 and the second value is 0, then the output is 1.
D. If the first value is 1 and the second value is 1, then the output is 0.","The correct answer is D.
 An XOR operation requires two inputs, and in the case of encryption algorithms,
this would be the data bits and the key bits. Each bit is fed into the operation�one
from the data, the next from the key�and then XOR makes a determination: if the
bits match, the output is 0; if they don�t, it�s 1."
D,D,"A is incorrect because known plain text doesn�t really have anything to do with this

determine repeating code.","C is incorrect because, in this instance, replay refers to the attack being described
in the question, not man in the middle. I know you think this is confusing, and I
do understand. However, this is an example of the CEH wordplay you�ll need to be
familiar with. Man in the middle is usually listed as an attack by every security guide;
however, within the context of the exam, it may also refer solely to where the attacker
has positioned himself. From this location, he can launch a variety of attacks�replay
being one of them.","Which of the following attacks attempts to re-send a portion of a cryptographic exchange
in hopes of setting up a communications channel?
A. Known plain text
B. Chosen plain text
C. Man in the middle
D. Replay","The correct answer is D.
 Replay attacks are most often performed within the context of a man-in-themiddle attack and not necessarily just for communications channel setup. They�re
also used for DoS attacks against a system, to feed bad data in hopes of corrupting a
system, to try to overflow a buffer (send more encrypted data than expected), and so
on. The hacker repeats a portion of a cryptographic exchange in hopes of fooling the
system into setting up a communications channel. The attacker doesn�t really have to
know the actual data (such as the password) being exchanged; he just has to get the
timing right in copying and then replaying the bit stream. Session tokens can be used
in the communications process to combat this attack."
D,D,"A is incorrect because, not only does this have nothing to do with proving identity,

private key can decrypt it.","B is incorrect because this has nothing to do with proving Sue�s identity. Sure, Bill
will be using his own private key to decrypt messages sent to him by other users;
however, it doesn�t provide any help in proving identity.","C is incorrect because there is no way Bill should have Sue�s private key. Remember,
private keys are not shared with anyone, for any reason. This is why encrypting a

A. Bill can be sure a message came from Sue by using his public key to decrypt it.
B. Bill can be sure a message came from Sue by using his private key to decrypt it.
C. Bill can be sure a message came from Sue by using her private key to decrypt the
digital signature.
D. Bill can be sure a message came from Sue by using her public key to decrypt the
digital signature","The correct answer is D.
 Remember, a digital signature is a hash value that is encrypted with the user�s
private key. Because the corresponding public key can decrypt it, this provides the
nonrepudiation feature we�re looking for. This is the only instance on the exam where
the private key is used for encryption. In general, public encrypts, and private decrypts.
The steps for creating an encrypted message with a digital signature are as follows:
1. Create a hash of the body of the message.
2. Encrypt that hash with your private key (adding it to the message as your signature).
3. Encrypt the entire message with the public key of the recipient."
D,D,A and B are incorrect because these are not certificate types.,C is incorrect because regular signed certificates are signed and verified by a thirdparty certificate authority (CA).,,"A systems administrator is applying digital certificates for authentication and verification

Keychain and uses the public key to sign documents that are used throughout the

A. Public
B. Private
C. Signed
D. Self-signed","The correct answer is D.
 Security certificates have many uses in networking: for example, applications
and network services might use them for authentication. If you are doing business
across the Internet, your clients will want to ensure a trusted third party signs your
certificates, so they can verify you are indeed legitimate. Internally, though, due to
cost and speed of deployment/maintenance, self-signed certificates are the way to go.
A self-signed certificate is simply one that is signed by the same entity that created
it. Because most of your internal certificate needs can be served without going to an
external CA to verify identity, using self-signed certificates may be the best bet."
D,D,"A is incorrect because this question is not describing a small location at a gate where

 If you took a test on college football history, you know it would contain a
question about Alabama. If you took one on trumpet players, there�d be one about
Dizzy Gillespie. And if you take a test on physical security measures for Certified
Ethical Hacker, you�re going to be asked about the man trap.
A man trap is nothing more than a locked space you can hold someone in while
verifying their right to proceed into the secured area. It�s usually a glass (or clear
plastic) walled room that locks the exterior door as soon as the person enters. Then
there is some sort of authentication mechanism, such as a smartcard with a PIN or a
biometric system. Assuming the authentication is successful, the second door leading
to the interior of the building will unlock, and the person is allowed to proceed. If
it�s not successful, the doors will remain locked until the guard can check things out.
As an aside, in addition to authentication, some man traps add other checks, such as
measuring the person�s weight to see if they�ve mysteriously gained or lost 20 pounds
since Friday.
A few other notes here may be of use to you: First, I�ve seen a man trap defined as
either manual or automatic, where manual has a guard locking and unlocking the
doors and automatic has the locks tied to the authentication system, as described
previously. Second, a man trap is also referred to in some definitions as an air lock.
Should you see that term on the exam, know that it is referring to the man trap.
Third, man traps in the real world can sometimes come in the form of a rotating
door or turnstile, locking partway around if the person doesn�t authenticate properly.
And, on some of the really fancy ones, sensors will lock the man trap if two people
are trying to get through at the same time.
And, finally, one last note of importance�a man trap is also defined or known as an
access control vestibule. Just rolls right off the tongue, doesn�t it?"

C. Technical support
D. Halo effect","The correct answer is C.
 Although it may seem silly to label social engineering attacks (because many
of them contain the same steps and bleed over into one another), you�ll need to
memorize them for your exam. A technical support attack is one in which the
attacker calls the support desk in an effort to gain a password reset or other useful
information. This is a valuable method because if you get the right help desk person

A. The lower the CER, the better the biometric system.
B. The higher the CER, the better the biometric system.
C. The higher the FRR, the better the biometric system.
D. The higher the FAR, the better the biometric system.","The correct answer is A.
 The crossover error rate (CER) is the point on a chart where the false acceptance
rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR) meet, and the lower the number, the better
the system. It�s a means by which biometric systems are calibrated�getting the FAR
and FRR the same. All that said, though, keep in mind that in certain circumstances
a client may be more interested in a lower FAR than FRR, or vice versa, and therefore
the CER isn�t as much a concern. For example, a bank may be far more interested
in preventing false acceptance than it is in preventing false rejection. In other words,
so what if a user is upset they can�t log on, so long as their money is safe from a false
acceptance?"
D,D,"A is incorrect because a technical support attack involves the attacker calling a technical

Impersonation can cover anybody, from a �normal� user to a company executive.

remember if you�re going through steps to have the user call you back, you�ve moved
into reverse social engineering.","C is incorrect because a phishing attack involves an e-mail crafted to appear legitimate

than just a phone number.","A pen tester sends an unsolicited e-mail to several users in the target organization. The
e-mail is well crafted and appears to be from the company�s help desk, advising users

several systems and receives phone calls from users asking for assistance. Which social
engineering practice is in play here?
A. Technical support
B. Impersonation
C. Phishing
D. Reverse social engineering","The correct answer is D.
 This may turn out to be a somewhat confusing question for some folks, but
it�s actually pretty easy. Reverse social engineering involves three steps. First, in the
marketing phase, an attacker advertises himself as a technical point of contact for
problems that may be occurring soon. Second, in the sabotage phase, the attacker
performs a denial of service or other attack on the user. Third, in the tech support
phase, the user calls the attacker and freely hands over information, thinking they are
being assisted by the company�s technical support team.
As an aside, there are two things to remember about employing this social engineering
practice in the real world. First, be sure to market to the appropriate audience:
attempting this against IT staff probably won�t work as well as the �average� user and
may get you caught. Second, and perhaps more important, you�ll need to remember
that the more lies you tell, the more things you have to make true. Complexity is risky,and reverse social engineering involves a lot of complexity. It�s best used in special
cases, and then only if you can�t find something else to do."

A. Phishing
B. Internet level
C. Reverse social engineering
D. Impersonation","The correct answer is A.
 Phishing is one of the most pervasive and effective social engineering attacks on
the planet. It�s successful because crafting a legitimate-looking e-mail that links a user
to an illegitimate site or malware package is easy to do. What�s more, the e-mail is
easy to spread, and it preys on our human nature to trust. If the source of the e-mail
looks legitimate or the layout looks legitimate, most people will click away without
even thinking about it. Phishing e-mails can often include pictures lifted directly off
the legitimate website and use creative means of spelling that aren�t easy to spot: www
.regions.com is a legitimate bank website that could be spelled in a phishing e-mail as
www.regi0ns.com.
When it comes to real-world use of phishing by ethical hackers and pen testers,
there are a couple items of note: First, phishing has an extreme liability aspect to it
when spoofing a legitimate business. If you�re pen testing an organization and phish
using a variant of a real business name, you could be opening yourself up to some
serious costs: the first time someone calls the real Regions bank to complain is the
moment that the attacker just became liable for the costs associated with the attack.
Second is the risk involved with people simply forwarding your phishing attempt
to recipients you never intended, allowing it to take on a life of its own. In short,
the pen tester will certainly limit the bait (malware or website link embedded in
the phishing attempt), but they will have no control over what a user decides to do
with the e-mail. Suppose the pen tester doesn�t know the exact IP range or makes a
simple mistake in the configuration of the malware, and a user sends it home. Or
to a banking friend. Or to the FBI. Or to a friend who works on a DoD system.
Now you�ve not only hooked the wrong fish but maybe infected something in the
government. That�s nothing to joke about, and it may be a lot worse than a simple
mistake. The bottom line is, in the real world, phishing is dangerous if not planned
and implemented almost perfectly, and pen test teams need to use extreme caution
in implementing it."

the network. Inside attacks are generally easier to launch, are more successful, and are
harder to prevent. When you add the human element of having an axe to grind, this
can boil over quickly�whether or not the employee has the technical knowledge to
pull off the attack. The idea that someone wanting to do harm to our organization�s

D. Drafting","The correct answer is C.
 This type of question is so annoying I added it twice, back to back, in this
chapter�almost as if I was nearly certain you�ll see it on your exam. Tailgating
involves following someone through an open door or gate just like piggybacking does;
however, in tailgating, a fake identification badge of some sort is used. As an aside, if
your exam question does not include both terms�tailgating and piggybacking�but
the effort is the same (an attacker following a badged employee through a gate or
door), you won�t have to choose between them. Usually, in this case, tailgating will be
used more frequently than piggybacking."
"A,B,D","A,B,D","C and E are both incorrect for the same reason: a social engineering attack doesn�t

 ECC identifies several countermeasures against social engineering, but

problem with most countermeasures against social engineering is they�re almost
totally out of your control. Sure, you can draft strong policy requiring users to
comply with security measures, implement guidelines on everything imaginable to
reduce risks and streamline efficiency, and hold educational briefings and training
sessions for each and every user in your organization, but when it comes down to it, it�s the user who has to do the right thing. All countermeasures for social engineering
have something to do with the users themselves because they are the weak link here."
"A,B,C,D","A,B,C,D",,,,"Which of the following are indicators of a phishing e-mail? (Choose all that apply.)
A. It does not reference you by name.
B. It contains misspelled words or grammatical errors.
C. It contains spoofed links.
D. It comes from an unverified source.","The correct answer is A, B, C, D.
 One of the objectives EC-Council has kept around in its many CEH
versions is, and I quote, to �understand phishing attacks.� Part of the official
curriculum to study for the exam covers detecting phishing e-mail in depth,
and all of these answers are indicators an e-mail might not be legitimate. First,
most companies now sending e-mail to customers will reference you by name
and sometimes by account number. An e-mail starting with �Dear Customer� or
something to that effect may be an indicator something is amiss.
Misspellings and grammatical errors from a business are also usually dead giveaways
because companies do their best to proofread items before they are released. There
are, occasionally, some slipups (Internet search some of these; they�re truly funny),
but those are definitely the exception and not the rule.
Spoofed links can be found by hovering a mouse over them (or by looking at their
properties). The link text may read www.yourbank.com, but the hyperlink properties
will be sending you to some IP address you don�t want to go to.
And finally, any e-mail coming from an �unverified source� can and should be viewed
with caution. What makes something an unverified source? That depends on the eye
of the beholder. In many cases, it�s simply an address (or person) you don�t know or
haven�t seen before. In others it�s a very close representation of an e-mail address you�d
recognize, but turns out to be malicious.
In any of these cases, your best bet for personal and organizational security is this:
Don�t Click It. It shouldn�t matter to you who the e-mail is from, whether it�s
grammatically perfect, and the links look legitimate�just put yourself in the habit of
not clicking links in e-mail at all. Trust me, you and your organization will be safer.
As an aside, while these are all great answers to a question on an exam, don�t let
them dictate your day-to-day Internet life outside of your exam. A perfectly written,
grammatically correct e-mail containing real links and originating from someone
you trust could still be part of a phishing campaign. Never click a link in an e-mail
without knowing exactly what it is and where it�s taking you�no matter who you
think the message is from or how well written it is. Finally, if you get a phishing e-mail that is accurate, references you by name, has real links, and truly appears to
be accurate, you probably have a real problem on your hands. Everyone gets the
annoying �spam� e-mails with �Click here for free stuff.� However, if you get one that
is delivered to you, with your name and identifying details in it, you have someone
who spent the time to target you specifically, not randomly."

 For obvious reasons, there are not a lot of questions from these objectives
concerning tools�mainly because social engineering is all about the human side of
things, not necessarily using technology or tools. However, you can put into place
more than a few protective applications to help stem the tide. There are innumerable
e-mail-filtering applications and appliances you can put on an e-mail network
boundary to cut down on the vast amount of traffic (spam or otherwise) headed
to your network. Additionally, Netcraft�s phishing toolbar and Phishtank are two client-side, host-based options you can use (there are others, but these are pointed out
specifically in EC-Council�s official courseware).
Netcraft�s (http://toolbar.netcraft.com/) and Phishtank�s (www.phishtank.com/) toolbars
are like neighborhood watches on virtual steroids, where eagle-eyed neighbors can
see suspicious traffic and alert everyone else. The following is from the Netcraft
site: �Once the first recipients of a phishing mail have reported the target URL, it is
blocked for community members as they subsequently access the URL.�
These tools, although useful, are not designed to completely protect against phishing.
Much like antivirus software, they will act on attempts that match a signature file.

 Have you ever watched nature documentaries on the Discovery Channel? It
seems predators frequently hang out in places where the prey tends to show up. For

well their prey will eventually just come to them. This attack uses the same principle,
except we�re talking about the virtual world. And none of us are lions (at least not
outside our imaginations, anyway).
In a watering hole attack, the bad guy spends a lot of time profiling the group that
is being targeted (note the key wording in this is that a group is targeted, not an
individual). The attacker can observe or even guess websites the group would visit,
and then infect those sites with some sort of malware or malicious code. Eventually,
someone from the group will visit the virtual watering hole and�voil��success."

 Once again, we�re back to the two major forms of social engineering: human based
and computer based. Human-based attacks include all the attacks mentioned here
and a few more. Human-based social engineering uses interaction in conversation

A. Trojan e-mailing
B. Spear phishing
C. Social networking
D. Operational engineering","The correct answer is B.
 Yes, sometimes you�ll get an easy one. Phishing is using e-mail to accomplish the
social engineering task. Spear phishing is actually targeting those e-mails to specific
individuals or groups within an organization. This usually has a much higher success
rate than just a blind-fire phishing effort."

required to type the word from the image into a challenge box. An example is on a
contest entry form�you type in your information at the top and then see an image
with a word (or two) in a crazy font at the bottom. If you type the correct word in, it�s
somewhat reasonable for the page to assume you�re a human (as opposed to a script),

D. CAPTCHA","The correct answer is B.
 Sign-in seal is an e-mail protection method in use at a variety of business locations.
The practice is to use a secret message or image that can be referenced on any official
communication with the site. If you receive an e-mail purportedly from the business
but it does not include the image or message, you�re aware it�s probably a phishing
attempt. This sign-in seal is kept locally on your computer, so the theory is that no

"A,B,C,D","A,B,C,D",,,,"Which of the following should be in place to assist as a social engineering
countermeasure? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Classification of information
B. Strong security policy
C. User education
D. Strong change management process","The correct answer is A, B, C, D.
 All of the answers are correct, but let�s get this out of the way up front:
you�ll never be able to put anything whatsoever into place that will effectively render
all social engineering attacks moot. You can do some things to limit them, and those
on this list can definitely help in that regard, but an organization that responds to
social engineering concerns with �We have a strong security policy and great user
education� is probably one that�ll see a high turnover rate.
Classification of information is seen as a strong countermeasure because the
information�and access to it�is stored and processed according to strict definitions
of sensitivity. In the government/DoD world, you�d see labels such as Confidential,
Secret, and Top Secret. In the commercial world, you might see Public, Sensitive, and
Confidential. I could write an entire chapter on the difference between DoD and
commercial labels and argue the finer points of various access control methods, but
we�ll stick just to this chapter and what you need here. As a side note, classification
of information won�t do you a bit of good if the enforcement of access to that
information, and the protection of it in storage or transit, is lax.
Strong security policy has been covered earlier in the chapter, so I won�t waste much
print space here on it. You must have a good one in place to help prevent a variety of
security failures; however, you can�t rely on it as a countermeasure on its own.
According to EC-Council, user education is not only a viable social engineering
countermeasure but it�s the best measure you can take. Anyone reading this book
who has spent any time at all trying to educate users on a production, enterpriselevel network is probably yelling right now because results can sometimes be spotty
at best. However, the weak point in the chain is the user, so we must do our best to
educate users on what to look for and what to do when they see it. There simply is no
better defense than a well-educated user (and by �well-educated� I mean a user who
absolutely refuses to participate in a social engineering attempt). There�s just not that
many of them out there.
A change management process helps to organize alterations to a system or
organization by providing a standardized, reviewable process to any major change.
In other words, if you allow changes to your financial system, IT services, or HR
processes without any review or control process, you�re basically opening Pandora�s
box. Change can be made on a whim (sometimes at the behest of a social engineer,
maybe?), and there�s no control or tracking of it."

A. Joe and Jill are using single-factor authentication.
B. Joe and Jill are using two-factor authentication.
C. Joe is using two-factor authentication.
D. Jill is using two-factor authentication.","The correct answer is D.
 When it comes to authentication systems, you can use three factors to prove your
identity: something you know, something you have, and something you are. An item
you know is, basically, a password or PIN. Something you have is a physical token of
some sort�usually a smartcard�that is presented as part of the authentication process.
Something you are relates to biometrics�a fingerprint or retinal scan, for instance.
Generally speaking, the more factors you have in place, the better (more secure) the
authentication system. In this example, Joe is using only something he knows, whereas
Jill is using something she has (PIV card) and something she knows (PIN)."
A,A,"B is incorrect because single factor refers to the method the authentication system
uses, not the physical security measure itself. In this case, the authentication is using

 Physical security measures are characterized as physical (door locks and guards),
operational (policies and procedures), and technical (authentications systems and
permissions). This example falls into the technical security measure category. Sure,
the door itself is physical, but the question centers on the biometric system, which is
clearly technical in origin."

 All security controls are put into place to minimize, or to avoid altogether, the

C. An attacker targets specific members of an organization based on their duties, roles,

D. An attacker inserts malicious code and malware into sites employees visit on a
regular basis.","The correct answer is B.
 I�m convinced there are folks who sit around doing nothing more than dreaming
up new terminology, acronyms, and slang for all of us to remember, and pharming
falls into this category. Pharming has the same end goal as most other attacks�
redirecting folks to malicious websites in hopes of stealing something from them.

A. Detection and analysis
B. Classification and prioritization
C. Containment
D. Forensic investigation","The correct answer is C.
 In a refrain you�ve heard over and over again throughout this book, sometimes real
life and EC-Council don�t see eye to eye. However, when it comes to IR, ECC kind
of gets it right. Almost. Lots of organizations define the incident-handling response
in different ways, with different phases for actions taken. Generally speaking, though,
all incident handling falls into four sets of actions: identify, contain, eradicate, and
recover. Most organizations will define a preparation phase beforehand and a lessons
learned phase at the end for a full incident process. ECC defines eight phases:
� Preparation Defining rules, processes, and toolsets and then testing them (usually
with some regularly scheduled exercises, at a minimum) occur in this phase.
� Detection and analysis This is where alerting functions (toolsets, IDS, IPS, users
notifying of strange events, and so on) and initial research into the event take place.
� Classification and prioritization Decision making on whether to elevate as
an incident and at what level to elevate is made here (ramping up an IR event for
a false alarm serves no one). Levels of categorization vary from organization to
organization, but usually assign response time frames to levels.
� Notification Alerting appropriate teams and organizations to assist in the event
occurs here.
� Containment Steps to contain the incident occur here. These may include
steps to revoke or suspend user accounts and blocking system or even subnet
access via a firewall or other method.
� Forensic investigation In this stage, if possible, live memory and disk captures
are pulled for evaluation and analysis. This does not have to wait until the
conclusion of the event, but, depending on the assets involved and the nature of
the incident, forensics may have to wait.
� Eradication and recovery This phase encompasses all the steps taken to remove
the incident cause (malware, malicious code, backdoors, rootkits, viruses, and so
on) and to return the assets involved to baseline standards before putting them
back into production.
� Post-incident This is where reporting, follow-up analysis, and lessons learned
are put together. Evaluation from this step is fed into the preparation phase for
the next event.
Questions on incident response and incident handling can be pretty vague. For
the most part, common sense should guide you on anything truly weird, but most
questions will be like this one�fairly easy to figure out on your own. One last note
here: the four phases listed at the beginning of this answer description will more than
likely be what you�ll see on the exam, so when in doubt, I would stick with them."
B,B,"A is incorrect because this does not describe acceptance. Acceptance of a risk means
the organization is aware a risk is present but due to a variety of reasons (such as cost
of mitigation or the unlikeliness the risk can ever be exploited) decides to do nothing
about it. Basically, the owner decides they will just deal with the fallout if the risk is
ever realized.","C is incorrect because this does not describe risk avoidance. In risk avoidance, the
organization recognizes the risk and eliminates anything and everything that has to do
with it. If a particular service, application, or technology is useful to an organization
but the cost and effort to deal with the risks involved in its use are too high, the
organization can simply choose to not use the service or application altogether.","D is incorrect because this does not describe mitigation. Risk mitigation is exactly
what it sounds like: the organization needs the technology or service despite the
risk involved, so it takes all steps necessary to lower the chance the risk will ever be
exploited. Purchasing and using antivirus and practicing strong patch management
are examples.","A software company puts an application through stringent testing and, on the date of

A. Accept
B. Transfer
C. Avoid
D. Mitigate","The correct answer is B.
 Depending on who you talk to, there are as many as seven different methods in
risk management. Of primary concern for you and EC-Council, however, are these
four: accept, avoid, transfer, and mitigate. In this example, the organization has paid
a cost to the software developer, trusting them that they�ve tested the software and
that they will assume responsibility and liability for it. In effect, the organization has
transferred the risk to the software company for this application. Transferring risk is
all about finding a different entity to take responsibility for managing the risk, as well
as accepting the liability of an exploitation or loss resulting from the risk."
"A,C,D","A,C,D","B, E, and F are incorrect for the same reason: they are all vulnerability assessment tool

 Automated tool suites for pen testing can be viewed as a means to save time
and money by the client�s management, but (in my opinion and in the real world, at
least) these tools don�t do either. They do not provide the same quality results as a test
performed by security professionals, and they are extremely expensive. Automated tools
can provide a lot of genuinely good information, but they are also susceptible to false
positives and false negatives and don�t necessarily care what your agreed-upon scope
says is your stopping point. Metasploit has a free, open source version and an insanely
expensive �Pro� version for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target
machine�still worlds cheaper than Core Impact, but expensive nonetheless. Metasploit
offers an autopwn module that can automate the exploitation phase of a penetration test.
Core Impact is probably the best-known, all-inclusive automated testing framework. Per
its website (https://www.coresecurity.com/core-impact), Core Impact �takes security
testing to the next level by safely replicating a broad range of threats to the organization�s
sensitive data and mission-critical infrastructure�providing extensive visibility into the
cause, effect, and prevention of data breaches.� Core Impact tests everything from web
applications and individual systems to network devices and wireless.
Per the Immunity Security website (www.immunitysec.com), CANVAS �makes
available hundreds of exploits, an automated exploitation system, and a comprehensive,
reliable exploit development framework to penetration testers and security professionals.�
Additionally, the company claims CANVAS�s Reference Implementation (CRI) is
�the industry�s first open platform for IDS and IPS testing.�
For you real-world purists out there and for those who don�t have any experience
with any of this just quite yet, it�s important to note that no automated testing suite
provides anything close to the results you�d gain from a real pen test. Core Impact
provides a one-step automated pen test result feature (and probably offers the best
result and report features), Metasploit offers autopwn, and CANVAS has a similar
�run everything� mode; however, all lack the ability to provide results that a true pen
test would provide. In the truest sense of �automated pen testing,� you simply can�t
do it in the real world (for your exam, stick with the three listed here)."

 A vulnerability assessment is exactly what it sounds like: the search for and
identification of potentially exploitable vulnerabilities on a system or network. These
vulnerabilities can be poor security configurations, missing patches, or any number of
other weaknesses a bad guy might exploit. The two keys to a vulnerability assessment
are that the vulnerabilities are identified, not exploited, and the report is simply a
snapshot in time. The organization will need to determine how often it wants to
run a vulnerability assessment. Lastly, it�s important to note that there are some
vulnerabilities that simply can�t be confirmed without exploiting them. For example,
the act of infecting SQL statements to expose an SQL injection vulnerability may
very well constitute an exploit action, but it�s the only way to prove it exists. For your
exam, though, stick with no exploitation during this assessment and move on with
your life."

 If you�ve ever taken any philosophy classes in high school or college, you�ve
undoubtedly read some of the ethical dilemmas presented to challenge black-and-white
thinking on a matter. For example, theft is undoubtedly bad and is recognized as a
crime in virtually every law system on the planet, but what if it�s the only way to save a
child�s life? In ethical hacking, there are fine lines on actions to take when you discover
something, and sometimes hard edges where there is no choice in the matter. Possession
of child porn is a crime, so this case would seem relatively easy to discern. To be fair, and
to make the assumption you�ll need to on questions like this on the exam, your course of
action is straightforward and simple: notify the authorities and let them handle it.
In the real world, things might be a little more difficult. How do you really know
what you�re looking at? Are you positive that what you see is illegal in nature
(regardless of what it is�pornography, documentation, letters, and so on)? If you�re
not and you falsely accuse someone, what kind of liability do you face? What about
your team? It�s not an easy question to answer when you�re in the heat of battle, and
you�ll have to largely depend on good, solid pen test agreements up front. Let the
client know what actions will be taken when suspected illegal material is discovered,

The inherent risk of the system is that which is in place if you implement no security
controls whatsoever: in other words, there are risks inherent to every system,
application, technology, and service. After you recognize these inherent risks and
implement security controls, you may have some residual risks remaining. In other
words, residual risk is what is left in the system after you implement security controls."

 EC-Council splits a pen test into three phases: pre-attack, attack, and post-attack.
In the attack phase, the team will attempt to penetrate the network perimeter, acquire
targets, execute attacks, and elevate privileges. Getting past the perimeter might take
into account things such as verifying ACLs by crafting packets as well as checking
the use of any covert tunnels inside the organization. Attacks such as XSS, buffer
overflows, and SQL injections will be used on web-facing applications and sites. After
specific targets are acquired, password cracking, privilege escalation, and a host of
other attacks will be carried out."
A,A,"B, C, and D are incorrect because these are not true statements. The attacking group

C. The group assisting in the defense of the systems is known as a white-hat group.
D. The team attacking the systems must provide all details of any planned attack
with the defense group before launching to ensure security measures are tested
appropriately","The correct answer is A.
 Many organizations run full �war game� scenarios, which include defense and
attack groups, to test security measures. Generally speaking, the group doing the
attacking is known as a red team, while the group assisting with the defense is
known as a blue team. The red team is the offense-minded group, simulating the
bad guys in the world, actively attacking and exploiting everything they can find
in the environment. In a traditional war game scenario, the red team is attacking
�black-box� style, given little to no information to start things off. A blue team, on
the other hand, is defensive in nature. The members of the blue team are not out
attacking things; rather, they�re focused on shoring up defenses and making things
safe. Unlike red teams, blue teams are responsible for defense against the bad guys,
so they usually operate with full knowledge of the internal environment.Blue teams are almost always independent in terms of the target, but their goal
is to assist the defenders and to do so with whatever information is available.
The difference between blue and red in this scenario is in the cooperative versus
adversarial nature: red is there to be the bad guys, do what they would do, look for
the impacts they would want to have, and to test the organization�s defense/response,
whereas blue is there to help."

 Nessus is probably the best-known, most utilized vulnerability assessment tool on

and Windows machines to SCADA devices, SNMP, and VMware ESX (you can find
a list of plug-in families at www.tenable.com/plugins/index.php?view=all). It�s part of
virtually every security team�s portfolio, and you should definitely spend some time
learning how to use it.
As an aside�not necessarily because it has anything to do with your test but because
I am all about informing you on how to become a good pen tester�OpenVAS
(www.openvas.org) is the open source community�s attempt at a free vulnerability
scanner. Nessus was a free scanner for the longest time. However, once Nessus was
purchased by Tenable Network Security, it, for lack of a better term, angered a lot of
people in the security community because Nessus became a for-profit entity instead
of a for-security one. Don�t get me wrong�Nessus is outstanding in what it does; it
just costs you money. OpenVAS is attempting to do the same thing for free because
the community wants security over profit.
Just keep in mind that most vulnerabilities that are actually capable of causing harm
to your systems probably won�t be found by any scanner. The recent Heartbleed
vulnerability, which takes advantage of an SSL issue, is a prime example: scanners
simply can�t find vulnerabilities we don�t already know about."

 So which came first�the chicken or the egg? This question is right along those
same lines and can be really confusing, but if you key on the �cause� portion of
the question, you should be okay. Sure, a vulnerability would need to be present;
however, a vulnerability on its own doesn�t cause anything. A threat is something
that could potentially take advantage of an existing vulnerability. Threats can be
intentional, accidental, human, or even an �act of God.� A hacker is a threat to take
advantage of an open port on a system and/or poor password policy. A thunderstorm
is a threat to exploit a tear in the roof, leaking down into your systems. Heck, a
rhinoceros is a threat to bust down the door and destroy all the equipment in the
room. Whether those threats have intent, are viable, and are willing/able to take up
the vulnerability is a matter for risk assessment to decide; they�ll probably beef up
password policy and fix the roof, but I doubt much will be done on the rhino front."

study materials available for CEH certification�that EC-Council wants you to know
some basics, and this question falls in that category. There are a bunch of different
payload types within Metasploit, and meterpreter (short for meta-interpreter) is one
of them. The following is from Metasploit�s website: �Meterpreter is an advanced
payload that is included in the Metasploit Framework. Its purpose is to provide
complex and advanced features that would otherwise be tedious to implement purely
in assembly. The way that it accomplishes this is by allowing developers to write their
own extensions in the form of shared object (DLL) files that can be uploaded and
injected into a running process on a target computer after exploitation has occurred.
Meterpreter and all of the extensions that it loads are executed entirely from memory
and never touch the disk, thus allowing them to execute under the radar of standard
anti-virus detection.�"

modular fashion, with each library and component responsible for its own function.

�The most fundamental piece of the architecture is the Rex library, which is short
for the Ruby Extension Library. Some of the components provided by Rex include a

D. Perform background checks on all employees.","The correct answer is A, B, C, D.
 All of the answers are correct. Admittedly, there�s nothing you can really
do to completely prevent an inside attack. There�s simply no way to ensure every
single employee is going to remain happy and satisfied, just as there�s no way to tell
when somebody might just up and decide to turn to crime. It happens all the time,
in and out of corporate America, so the best you can do is, of course, the best you
can do.
Enforcing elevated privilege control (that is, ensuring users have only the amount
of access, rights, and privileges to get their job done, and no more) seems like a
commonsense thing, but it�s amazing how many enterprise networks simply ignore
this. After all, a disgruntled employee with administrator rights on his machine can
certainly do more damage than one with just plain user rights. Securing dumpsters
and practicing good physical security should help protect against an insider who wants
to come back after hours and snoop around. And performing background checks
on employees, although by no means a silver bullet in this situation, can certainly help to ensure you�re hiring the right people in the first place (in many companies a
background check is a requirement of law). Here are some of the other steps:
� Monitor user network behavior.

 The commands in Windows will definitely make an appearance on your exam, and because it�s impossible to tell which syntax or command structure will be shown to you, you should learn them all. In this example, the net user command lists all users on the machine. Next, the exam member used the net user USERNAME PASSWORD command�where USERNAME equates to the user to update and PASSWORD is the password to set for the user. In this example, the user�USER1�had his password updated to user2. Other net user options include ADD, DELETE, TIMES, and ACTIVE. No commands used in the security context you are logged on as, so ensure you�re actually an administrator on the machine before attempting many of them. As a useful aside, keep in mind you�ll probably see a few tricks like this (using �user2� as a password) on your exam. Syntax matters, and it�ll be manipulated quite a bit on your test.

Yes, this question may be, admittedly, a little on the �hokey� side, but it�s valid insofar as EC-Council is concerned. The point here is that TOR (The Onion Routing; https://www.torproject.org/) provides a quick, easy, and really groovy way to hide your user identity when performing almost anything online. According to the site, �Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location.� (For the real-world folks out there, just know that without law enforcement and some serious work visibility, you�d probably be successful in hacking on the first hop, but that�d be it.) TOR is dynamic by nature, and a hacker can simply use a different path for each attack. Just remember the question is really about identifying TOR as a means of covering tracks and not necessarily an analysis of how it really works. Were this a discussion based in reality, we�d be more interested in how Amanda would determine the connection was bouncing around proxies in the first place: more realistically, she might detect several similar connections leveraging the same access that were coming from several different countries."

Which of the following statements best describes the HOSTS file? 
A. A user on the machine attempting to go to check their bank account at mybank.com will be directed to a Chinese IP address instead.
B. A user on the machine attempting to go to google.com will receive an HTTP error code of 400. 
C. A user on the machine attempting to go to gmail.com will be directed to the local host.
 
D. Any DNS resolution to IP 220.181.0.16 will be directed to one of the five sites listed in a round-robin fashion.
","The correct answer is A.
 The HOSTS file is a thing of beauty or an instrument of horror and woe, depending on how you look at it. Before any Windows system ever bothers to check DNS for an IP matching a name request, it checks the HOSTS file first. For example, when the user types www.mybank.com in their browser and presses enter, Windows checks the HOSTS file to see if there is a mapping for mybank.com. If there is one, that�s where the user will go. If there�s not, Windows will ask DNS for an IP to use. Therefore, if you edit your own HOSTS file, you can save yourself from lots of ads and scam sites (just direct them to localhost) and ensure your kids don�t accidentally go somewhere they�re not supposed to. If you get a hold of your target�s HOSTS file, you can send them anywhere you want.

In this example, it appears someone has gotten a hold of this particular machine�s HOSTS file and has edited it to send some common URL requests to a Chinese IP. Maybe they�ve set up fake versions of these sites in order to grab credentials. Or maybe they just want to DoS the user. In any case, any attempt to go to mybank.com, google.com, gmail.com, amazon.com, or facebook.com will immediately get directed to the Chinese IP listed. The only way the user could avoid this is to use IP addresses instead of named URLs. Oh, and one more thing: Just how do we know it�s a Chinese IP address? Whois, of course, when you determine the 220.181.0.0/19 block is assigned to CHINANET."
B,B,"A, C, and D are all incorrect because they do not match the syntax for opening Computer Management.",,,"Which of the following opens the Computer Management MMC in a Windows command line?
A. compmgm.mmc
 
B. compmgm.msc 
C. compmgm.exe 
D. compumgm.exe","The correct answer is B.
 Admittedly this one is an easy pick�assuming, of course, you�ve studied and know your MMCs in Windows. You have studied them, right? Because if you had, you�d know that the Microsoft Management Consoles can be used for a variety of tasks. Some of these MMCs include Computer Management, Device Manager, Event Viewer, Group Policy Editor, and Active Directory Users and Computers.

While you can create your own custom MMC by typing mmc in the command line and then using Add/Remove Snap-In from the menu line, you can also just open the individual consoles themselves by using their �msc� command-line option. For example, Computer Management can be a snap-in for a custom MMC, or you can open it by itself using the compmgmt.msc command. Others you may want to know for future reference include AD Users and Computers (dsa.msc), Device Manager (devmgmt.msc), Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc), Local Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc), and Local Security Settings Manager (secpol.msc)."

D. c:> list file1.exe$hidden.exe > visible.exe","The correct answer is A.
 This is the correct syntax. The cat command will extract the executable directly into the folder you execute the command from. NTFS file streaming allows you to hide virtually any file behind any other file, making it invisible to directory searches. The file can be a text file, to remind you of steps to take when you run the target, or even an executable file you can run at your leisure later. Alternate data streams (ADS) in the form of NTFS file streaming is a feature of the Windows-native NTFS to ensure compatibility with Apple file systems (called HFS). Be careful on the exam�you will see ADS and NTFS file streaming used interchangeably. As an aside, the cat command isn�t available on Windows 7 and Windows 10 machines (you�ll need a Linux emulator or something like it to use the cat command on these). What�s more, you can use c:\> (more<file1.txt:hidden.exe) > output.txt as another option. This will read the output of the hidden stream and write it to the output.txt file without having to use cat."

E. chmod 744 file1","The correct answer is E. You�re going to need to know some basic Linux commands to survive this exam, and one command I can guarantee you�ll see a question on is chmod. File permissions in Linux are assigned via the use of the binary equivalent for each rwx group: read is equivalent to 4, write to 2, and execute to 1. To accumulate permissions, you add the numbers: 4 is read-only, 6 is read and write, and adding execute to the bunch results in 7. As an aside, if you think in binary, the numbers are just as easy to define: 111 equates to 7 in decimal, and each bit turned on gives read, write, and execute. Setting the bits to 101 turns on read, turns off write, and turns on execute; and its decimal equivalent is 5."

Password: If a shadow file is being used, an x will be displayed here. If not, you�ll see a crypted password (in current OS versions), and only if you are root. As an aside, setting this to an asterisk (*) is a method to deactivate an account.
UID: The user identifier is used by the operating system for internal purposes. It is typically incremented by 1 for each new user added.
GID: The group identifier identifies the primary group of the user. All files that are created by this user will normally be accessible to this group, unless a chmod command prevents it (which is the reason for the �initial� portion of the question).
Gecos: This is a descriptive field for the user, generally containing contact information separated by commas.

Kerberos makes use of both symmetric and asymmetric encryption technologies to securely transmit passwords and keys across a network. The entire process consists of a key distribution center (KDC), an authentication service (AS), a ticket-granting service (TGS), and the ticket-granting ticket (TGT). A basic Kerberos exchange starts with a client asking the KDC, which holds the AS and TGS, for a ticket, which will be used to authenticate throughout the network. This request is in clear text. The server will respond with a secret key, which is hashed by the password copy kept on the server (passwords are never sent�only hashes and keys). This is known as the TGT. The client decrypts the message, since it knows the password, and the TGT is sent back to the server requesting a TGS service ticket. The server responds with the service ticket, and the client is allowed to log on and access network resources."

 A hybrid attack is a variation of a dictionary attack. In this form, you still have a wordlist; however, the cracker is smart enough to replace letters and characters within those words. For example, both attacks might use a list containing the word Password. To have multiple variations of it, the dictionary attack would need to have each variation added to the list individually (P@ssword, Pa$$word, and so on). A hybrid attack would require the wordlist only to include Password because it would swap out characters and letters to find different versions of the same word."

C. c3HisH@RD!

 You will certainly see LM hashes on your exam at least once or twice, and usually in this type of scenario. EC-Council isn�t just going to come out and ask you if you know that the last half of the LM hash is always the same if the password is seven characters or less�they�re going to show it in a scenario and see if you remember it in the stress of the exam. For review purposes, LM splits any password into two seven-character pieces and hashes each piece. If the password is seven characters or less, the last half of the hash is always the value of a hash of nothing (which equates to AAD3B435B51404EE, by the way). In this question, apply the LM �splitting� of passwords into two separate groups of seven characters, and it�s easy to see the answer: the first seven characters are CEHhad and the second seven do not exist, so the hash of CEHhad equals 3A02DF5289CF6EEF, and the hash of the blank characters equals AAD3B435B51404EE. On a final note, because it�s late here, don�t get hung up on password complexity unless it is explicitly noted in the question. Most people are in a rush during the exam and may not read things carefully. Glancing at the answers, these folks might pick the complex password by mistake. Therefore, use caution in reading the questions�make sure to fully understand what they�re asking for before just clicking the choice and moving on."

Kerberos makes use of a key distribution center (KDC) and grants tickets to properly authenticated clients to access resources on the network.,"Which authentication method uses DES for encryption and forces 14-character passwords for hash storage? 
A. NTLMv1 
B. NTLMv2 
C. LAN Manager 
D. Kerberos","The correct answer is C.
 LAN Manager is an old authentication model that burst onto the scene around the Windows 95 launch. It uses DES as a cipher standard (a 56-bit key DES, to be technical) and, as covered before, has a quirky habit of capitalizing passwords and splitting them into two seven-character halves. Believe it or not, this is still in use in the field. It�s mostly found in places where backward compatibility was needed for something and, eventually, it was just forgotten or overlooked."
