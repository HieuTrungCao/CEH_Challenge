1,C,C,1,"A is incorrect because, as I just mentioned, it’s impossible to reduce risk to absolute zero and still have a functional system. CEH Certified Ethical Hacker All-in-One Exam Guide, Fifth Edition, discusses the Security, Functionality, and Usability triangle, where as you move toward more security, you move further away from functionality and usability.","B is incorrect because it’s just silly. If you’re a security professional and your response to a risk—any risk—is to ignore it, I can promise you won’t be employed for long. Sure, you can point out that it’s low or residual and that the chance for actual exploitation is next to nonexistent, but you can’t ignore it. Best effort is for kindergarten trophies and IP packet delivery.","D is incorrect because removing all controls is worse than ignoring the risk. If you remove everything, then all risks remain. Remember, the objective is to balance your security controls to cover as much risk as possible while leaving the system as usable and functional as possible.","A security team is implementing various security controls across the organization. After considering several configurations and applications, a final agreed-on set of security controls is put into place; however, not all risks are mitigated by the controls. Of the following, which is the next best step?
A. Continue applying controls until all risk is eliminated. 
B. Ignore any remaining risk as “best effort controlled.” 
C. Ensure that any remaining risk is residual or low and accept the risk. 
D. Remove all controls.","The correct answer is C.
 Remember at the beginning of this chapter when I said the process of elimination may be your best bet in some cases? Well, even if you aren’t well-versed in risk management and security control efforts, you could narrow this down to the correct answer. It is impossible to remove all risk from any system and still have it usable. I’m certain there are exceptions to this rule (maybe super-secret machines in underground vaults buried deep within the earth, running on geothermal-powered batteries, without any network access at all and controlled by a single operator who hasn’t seen daylight in many years), but in general the goal of security teams has always been to reduce risk to an acceptable level."
2,A,A,1,"B is incorrect because, although it is mentioned as part of step 2, it’s actually secondary to scanning. Enumerating is used to gather more in-depth information about a target you already discovered by scanning. Things you might discover in scanning are IPs that respond to a ping. In enumerating each “live” IP, you might find open shares, user account information, and other goodies.","C is incorrect because reconnaissance and footprinting are interchangeable in CEH parlance. An argument can be made that footprinting is a specific portion of an overall recon effort; however, in all CEH documentation, these terms are used interchangeably.","D is incorrect because it references an attack. As usual, there’s almost always one answer you can throw out right away, and this is a prime example. We’re talking about step 2 in the methodology, where we’re still figuring out what targets are there and what vulnerabilities they may have. Attacking, at this point, is folly.","A Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) follows a specific methodology for testing a system. Which step comes after footprinting in the CEH methodology?
A. Scanning 
B. Enumeration 
C. Reconnaissance 
D. Application attack","The correct answer is A.
 CEH methodology is laid out this way: reconnaissance (footprinting), scanning and enumeration, gaining access, escalating privileges, maintaining access, and covering tracks. While you may be groaning about scanning and enumeration both appearing as answers, they’re placed here in this way on purpose. This exam is not only testing your rote memorization of the methodology but also how the methodology actually works. Remember, after scoping out the recon on your target, your next step is to scan it. After all, you have to know what targets are there first before enumerating information about them."
3,B,B,1,A is incorrect because a business continuity plan (BCP) contains all the procedures that should be followed in the event of an organizational outage—such as a natural disaster or a cyberattack. BCPs include the order in which steps should be taken and which system should be returned to service first. BCPs include DRPs (disaster recovery plans).,"C is incorrect because a disaster recovery plan (DRP) contains steps and procedures for restoring a specific resource (service, system, and so on) after an outage. Usually DRPs are part of a larger BCP.","D is incorrect because the annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is a mathematical measurement of the cost of replacing or repairing a specific resource. ALE is calculated by multiplying the single loss expectancy (SLE) by the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO). For example, if the total cost of a single loss of a resource is calculated at $1000 and you calculate there is a 10 percent chance it will fail in any given year, your ALE would be $100.","Your organization is planning for the future and is identifying the systems and processes critical for their continued operation. Which of the following best describes this effort?
A. BCP
B. BIA 
C. DRP 
D. ALE","The correct answer is B.
 A business impact analysis (BIA) best matches this description. In a BIA, the organization looks at all the systems and processes in use and determines which ones are absolutely critical to continued operation. Additionally, the assessor (the person or company conducting the analysis) will look at all the existing security architecture and make an evaluation on the likelihood of any system or resource being compromised. Part of this is assigning values to systems and services, determining the maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) for any, and identifying any overlooked vulnerabilities."
4,A,A,1,B is incorrect because the identification phase refers to the steps taken to verify the legitimacy of an active incident and gather information on the details of the attack.,C is incorrect because the containment phase deals with the steps taken to reduce or prevent the spread of the infection or attack inside the network.,D is incorrect because the recovery phase deals with the steps taken to restore and replace any resources damaged or affected by the attack footprint.,"Which incident response (IR) phase is responsible for setting rules, identifying the workforce and roles, and creating backup and test plans for the organization? 
A. Preparation 
B. Identification 
C. Containment 
D. Recovery","The correct answer is A.
 So even if you weren’t aware of incident response phases, this one should’ve been a rather easy guess. In the preparation phase, your IR (incident response) team should be preparing for an incident. Preparation includes lots of things—some of which are mentioned here. But virtually anything you can think of that does not involve actions taken during the incident belongs here. Training, exercises, and policies are all examples. As an aside, IR phases can be different depending on whom you ask and what the moon phase is, but generally IR is broken down into six phases: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Preparation we already covered. Identification refers to the steps taken to verify it’s actually an incident, and all the information surrounding that—source, destination(s), exploit used, malware used, and so on. Containment is the step used to cordon off the infected system(s) and prevent any further spread of infection or attack. Eradication refers to steps taken to remove the malware (or other attack-related residuals, such as backdoors). Recovery involves the steps taken to rebuild and restore the system(s) and network to pre-attack status (with better security, I might add). Finally, lessons learned is exactly what it sounds like, and it should feed right back into your organization’s preparation phase."
5,B,B,1,"A is incorrect because the textbook definition of a white-box test is one where all knowledge is provided to the pen tester up front—the test is designed to simulate an admin on your network who, for whatever reason, decides to go on the attack. For most pen testers, this test is really just unfair. It’s tantamount to sending them into the Roman Colosseum armed with a .50-caliber automatic weapon to battle a gladiator who is holding a knife.","C is incorrect because black-box testing indicates no knowledge at all. And if you think about it, the name is easy to correlate and remember: black = no light. Therefore, you can’t “see” anything. This is the test most people think about when it comes to hacking. You know nothing and are (usually) attacking from the outside.","D is incorrect because, as far as I can tell from the EC-Council’s documentation, there is no terminology for a “hybrid-box” test. This is a little tricky because the term hybrid is used elsewhere—for attacks and other things. If you apply a little common sense here, this answer is easy to throw out. If you know everything about the target, it’s white. If you know nothing, it’s black. If you’re in the middle, it’s gray. See?","You’ve been hired as part of a pen test team. During the brief, you learn the client wants the pen test attack to simulate a normal user who finds ways to elevate privileges and create attacks. Which test type does the client want? 
A. White box 
B. Gray box 
C. Black box 
D. Hybrid","The correct answer is B.
 A gray-box test is designed to replicate an inside attacker. Otherwise known as the partial knowledge attack (don’t forget this term), the idea is to simulate a user on the inside who might know a little about the network, directory structure, and other resources in your enterprise. You’ll probably find this one to be the most enlightening attack in out-briefing your clients in the real world—it’s amazing what you can get to when you’re a trusted, inside user. As an aside, you’ll often find in the real world that gray-box testing can also refer to a test where any inside information is given to a pen tester—you don’t necessarily need to be a fully knowledgeable inside user. In other words, if you have usable information handed to you about your client, you’re performing gray-box testing."
6,A,A,1,"B is incorrect because while authorized access control may sound great, it’s not a valid term.","C is incorrect because role-based access control can use MAC or discretionary access control to get the job done. With RBAC, the goal is to assign a role, and any entity holding that role can perform the duties associated with it. Users are not assigned permissions directly; they acquire them through their role (or roles). The roles are assigned to the user’s account, and each additional role provides its own unique set of permissions and rights.","D is incorrect because discretionary access control (DAC) allows the data owner, the user, to set security permissions for the object. If you’re on a Windows machine right now, you can create files and folders and then set sharing and permissions on them as you see fit. MAC administrators in the Department of Defense are shuddering at that thought right now.","Which of the following is defined as ensuring the enforcement of organizational security policy does not rely on voluntary user compliance by assigning sensitivity labels on information and comparing this to the level of security a user is operating at? 
A. Mandatory access control 
B. Authorized access control 
C. Role-based access control 
D. Discretionary access control","The correct answer is A.
 Access control is defined as the selective restraint of access to a resource, and there are several overall mechanisms to accomplish this goal. Mandatory access control (MAC) is one type that constrains the ability of a subject to access or perform an operation on an object by assigning and comparing “sensitivity labels.” Suppose a person (or a process) attempts to access or edit a file. With MAC, a label is placed on the file indicating its security level. If the entity attempting to access it does not have that level, or higher, then access is denied. With mandatory access control, security is centrally controlled by a security policy administrator, and users do not have the ability to override security settings. This should not be confused with role-based access control (RBAC) systems, which may actually use MAC to get the job done. The difference is in whether the information itself has a labeled description or whether the person accessing it has their own label. For example, in a classified area, the information classified as Top Secret will have a label on it identifying it as such, while you, as an auditor, will have your own clearance and need-to-know label allowing you to access certain information. MAC is a property of an object; RBAC is a property of someone accessing an object."
7,C,C,1,A is incorrect because the initial sequence number is set in the first step.,B is incorrect for the same reason—the ISN is set in the first step.,D is incorrect because this activity occurs in the second step.,"Which of the following statements is true regarding the TCP three-way handshake? 
A. The recipient sets the initial sequence number in the second step. 
B. The sender sets the initial sequence number in the third step. 
C. When accepting the communications request, the recipient responds with an acknowledgement and a randomly generated sequence number in the second step. 
D. When accepting the communications request, the recipient responds with an acknowledgement and a randomly generated sequence number in the third step.","The correct answer is C.
 The three-way handshake will definitely show up on your exam, and in much trickier wording than this. It’s easy enough to memorize “SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK,” but you’ll need more than that for the exam. In step 1, the host sends a segment to the server, indicating it wants to open a communications session. Inside this segment, the host turns on the SYN flag and sets an initial sequence number (any random 32-bit number). When the recipient gets the segment, it crafts a segment in response to let the host know it’s open and ready for the communications session. It does this by turning on the SYN and ACK flags, acknowledging the initial sequence number by incrementing it, and adding its own unique sequence number. Then, when the host gets this response back, it sends one more segment before the comm channel opens. In this segment, it sets the ACK flag and acknowledges the other’s sequence number by incrementing it. For example, suppose Host A is trying to open a channel with Server B.
 In this example, Host A likes the sequence number 2000, while Server B likes 5000. The first segment would look like this: SYN=1, ACK=0, ISN=2000. The response segment would look like this: SYN=1, ACK=1, ISN=5000, ACK NO=2001. The third and final segment would appear this way: SYN=0, ACK=1, SEQ NO=2001, ACK NO=5001."
8,D,D,1,"A is incorrect because this value equates to the ALE for the example. ALE = ARO × SLE. In this example, the ARO is 20 percent and the SLE is $1480: cost of a server ($1000) plus the cost of technician work to replace it ($80) plus lost time for workers (10 employees × 2 hours × $20 an hour, which works out to $400). Therefore, ALE = 20 percent × $1480, or $296.","B is incorrect because this value corresponds to the SLE for this scenario. The SLE is the total cost for a single loss, so we need to count the cost of the server, plus the cost of the technician’s hours, plus any downtime measurements for other workers. In this case, SLE = $1000 (cost of server) + $80 (server tech hours) + $400 (10 employees × 2 hours × $20 an hour), or $1480.",C is incorrect because this number doesn’t match the ARO for the example.,"Your network contains certain servers that typically fail once every five years. The total cost of one of these servers is $1000. Server technicians are paid $40 per hour, and a typical replacement requires two hours. Ten employees, earning an average of $20 per hour, rely on these servers, and even one of them going down puts the whole group in a wait state until it’s brought back up. Which of the following represents the ARO for a server? 
A. $296 
B. $1480 
C. $1000 
D. 0.20","The correct answer is D.
 When performing business impact analysis (or any other value analysis for that matter), the annualized loss expectancy (ALE) is an important measurement for every asset. To compute the ALE, multiply the annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) by the single loss expectancy (SLE). The ARO is the frequency at which a failure occurs on an annual basis. In this example, servers fail once every five years, so the ARO would be 1 failure / 5 years = 20 percent."
9,A,A,1,"B is incorrect because although the attacker is one of the good guys (a white hat, proceeding with permission and an agreement in place), he is not provided with full knowledge of the system. In fact, it’s quite the opposite—according to the question he knows absolutely nothing about the system, making this particular “box” as black as it can be. A white-box target indicates one that the attacker already knows everything about. It’s lit up and wide open.","C is incorrect right off the bat because it references a black hat. Black-hat attackers are the bad guys—the ones proceeding without the target’s knowledge or permission. They usually don’t have inside knowledge of their target, so their attacks often start “black box.”","D is incorrect for the same reason just listed: because this attacker has permission to proceed and is operating under an agreement, he can’t be a black-box attacker. Additionally, this answer went the extra mile to convince you it was wrong—and missed on both swings. Not only is this a white-hat attacker, but the attack itself is black box. A gray-box attack indicates at least some inside knowledge of the target.","An ethical hacker is given no prior knowledge of the network and has a specific framework in which to work. The agreement specifies boundaries, nondisclosure agreements, and a completion date definition. Which of the following statements is true? 
A. A white hat is attempting a black-box test. 
B. A white hat is attempting a white-box test. 
C. A black hat is attempting a black-box test. 
D. A black hat is attempting a gray-box test.","The correct answer is A.
 I love these types of questions. Not only is this a two-for-one question, but it involves identical but confusing descriptors, causing all sorts of havoc. The answer to attacking such questions—and you will see them, by the way—is to take each section one at a time. Start with what kind of hacker he is. He’s hired under a specific agreement, with full knowledge and consent of the target, thus making him a white hat. That eliminates C and D right off the bat. Second, to address what kind of test he’s performing, simply look at what he knows about the system. In this instance, he has no prior knowledge at all (apart from the agreement), thus making it a black-box test."
10,A,A,1,B is incorrect because a concept of operations (CONOPS) isn’t detective in nature. A CONOPS defines what a system is and how it is supposed to be used.,C is incorrect because a procedure is a document the spells out specific step-by-step instructions for a given situation or process.,"D is incorrect because smartcard authentication is a preventive control, not a detective one. It’s designed to provide strong authentication, ideally preventing a problem in the first place. 
E is incorrect because a process can refer to a lot of different things, depending on your definition and viewpoint, but is not detective in nature as a control. A process, in general, refers to a set of steps or actions directed at accomplishing a goal.
","Which of the following is a detective control? 
A. Audit trail 
B. CONOPS 
C. Procedure 
D. Smartcard authentication 
E. Process","The correct answer is A.
 A detective control is an effort used to identify problems, errors, or (in the case of post-attack discovery) cause or evidence of an exploited vulnerability—and an audit log or trail is a perfect example. Ideally, detective controls should be in place and working such that errors can be corrected as quickly as possible. Many compliance laws and standards (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is one example) mandate the use of detective controls."
11,B,B,1,"A is incorrect because the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) isn’t designed to control the dissemination of PII or sensitive data. Its primary goal is to ensure the security of government systems by promoting a standardized approach to security controls, implementation, and testing. The act requires government agencies to create a security plan for their systems and to have it “accredited” at least once every three years","C is incorrect because the PATRIOT Act is not an effort to control personal information. Its purpose is to aid the U.S. government in preventing terrorism by increasing the government’s ability to monitor, intercept, and maintain records on almost every imaginable form of communication. As a side effect, it has also served to increase observation and prevention of hacking attempts on many systems.","D is incorrect because the Freedom of Information Act wasn’t designed to tell you what to do with information. Its goal is to define how you can get information— specifically information regarding how your governments work. It doesn’t necessarily help you in hacking, but it does provide a cover for a lot of information. Anything you uncover that could have been gathered through the Freedom of Information Act is considered legal and should be part of your overall test.","As part of a pen test on a U.S. government system, you discover files containing Social Security numbers and other sensitive personally identifiable information (PII). You are asked about controls placed on the dissemination of this information. Which of the following acts should you check? 
A. FISMA 
B. Privacy Act 
C. PATRIOT Act 
D. Freedom of Information Act","The correct answer is B.
 The Privacy Act of 1974 protects information of a personal nature, including Social Security numbers. The Privacy Act defines exactly what “personal information” is, and it states that government agencies cannot disclose any personal information about an individual without that person’s consent. It also lists 12 exemptions for the release of this information (for example, information that is part of a law enforcement issue may be released). In other questions you see, keep in mind that the Privacy Act generally will define the information that is not available to you during and after a test. Dissemination and storage of private information needs to be closely controlled to keep you out of hot water. As a side note, how you obtain PII is oftentimes just as important as how you protect it once discovered. In your real-world adventures, keep the Wiretap Act (18 U.S. Code Chapter 119—Wire and Electronic Communications Interception and Interception of Oral Communications) and others like it in mind."
12,B,B,1,"A is incorrect because in the Command and Control (C2) stage, a C2 channel is created to pass data and control information back and forth.","C is incorrect because in the Installation stage, the malware is actually installed on the target.","D is incorrect because in the Exploitation stage, a vulnerability is exploited via executing code on the target system.","In which step of the Cyber Kill Chain methodology would an adversary create a deliverable malicious payload? 
A. Command and Control (C2) 
B. Weaponization 
C. Installation 
D. Exploitation","The correct answer is B.
 Originally developed from a military model by Lockheed Martin (https:// lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) seeking to quantify how to identify, prepare to attack, engage, and destroy the cyber enemy target, the Cyber Kill Chain is a methodology for tracing the stages of a cyberattack. Covering everything from early reconnaissance to data exfiltration (or worse), it has evolved to help security professionals better understand and combat adversarial efforts. The methodology includes seven steps—Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control (C2), and Actions on Objectives—detailing an attack from inception to closure. In the Weaponization stage, adversaries create the deliverable malicious payload using an exploit, and in the next stage, Delivery, they send it merrily along the way."
13,C,C,1,"A is incorrect because the acceptance of risk means the organization understands the risk is there, but they don’t do anything about it. Why would a company take this action? Perhaps the chance a threat agent will (or even can) exploit the risk is so low it makes the effort to mitigate it pointless. Or it could be the cost to mitigate simply is more than any damage or recovery from exploitation in the first place. In any case, if the organization does nothing, they’re accepting risk.","B is incorrect because avoidance of risk means the organization takes steps to eliminate the service, action, or technology altogether. In other words, the risk is deemed so great the company would rather do without the asset or service in the first place. In the case of social engineering, unless the organization can work without employees, avoiding this risk is nearly impossible.","D is incorrect because transferring risk occurs when the organization puts the burden of risk on another party. For example, the company might hire an insurance company to pay off in the event a risk is exploited.","An organization’s leadership is concerned about social engineering and hires a company to provide training for all employees. How is the organization handling the risk associated with social engineering? 
A. They are accepting the risk. 
B. They are avoiding the risk. 
C. They are mitigating the risk. 
D. They are transferring the risk.","The correct answer is C.
 When it comes to risks, there are four different methods of attempting to deal with them. In risk mitigation, steps are taken to reduce the chance that the risk even will occur, and in this example that’s exactly what’s happening. Training on social engineering should help reduce the likelihood an employee will fall victim (real-life concerns on this notwithstanding—we are talking about test questions here)."
14,B,B,1,"A is incorrect because the reconnaissance phase is nothing more than the steps taken to gather evidence and information on the targets you want to attack. Activities that occur in this phase include dumpster diving and social engineering. Another valuable tool in recon is the Internet. Look for any of these items as key words in answers on your exam. Of course, in the real world, you may actually gather so much information in your recon you’ll already be way ahead of the game in identifying targets and whatnot, but when it comes to the exam, stick with the hard-and-fast boundaries they want you to remember and move on.","C is incorrect because the gaining access phase is all about attacking the machines themselves. You’ve already figured out background information on the client and have enumerated the potential vulnerabilities and security flaws on each target. In this phase, you break out the big guns and start firing away. Key words you’re looking for here are the attacks themselves: accessing an open and unsecured wireless access point, manipulating network devices, writing and delivering a buffer overflow, and performing SQL injection against a web application are all examples.","D is incorrect because this phase is all about backdoors and the steps taken to ensure you have a way back in. For the savvy readers out there who noticed I skipped a step here (escalating privileges), well done. Key words you’ll look for on this phase (maintaining access) are backdoors, zombies, and rootkits.
E is incorrect because this phase is all about cleaning up when you’re done and making sure no one can see where you’ve been. Clearing tracks involves steps to conceal success and avoid detection by security professionals. Steps taken here consist of removing or altering log files, concealing files via hidden attributes or directories, and even using tunneling protocols to communicate with the system.","In which phase of the ethical hacking methodology would a hacker be expected to discover available targets on a network? 
A. Reconnaissance 
B. Scanning and enumeration 
C. Gaining access 
D. Maintaining access 
E. Covering tracks","The correct answer is B.
 The scanning and enumeration phase is where you’ll use things such as ping sweeps to discover available targets on the network. This step occurs after reconnaissance. In this step, tools and techniques are actively applied to information gathered during recon to obtain more in-depth information on the targets. For example, reconnaissance may show a network subnet to have 500 or so machines connected inside a single building, whereas scanning and enumeration would discover which ones are Windows machines and which ones are running FTP. As an aside, it’s important to remember these phases and definitions are exactly what you’ll need to pass your exam, but in the real world, actions and findings don’t necessarily fit cleanly into predefined roles and definitions."
15,C,C,1,"A is incorrect because the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA; https://www.ftc.gov/ tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act) requires financial institutions—companies that offer consumers financial products or services such as loans, financial or investment advice, or insurance—to explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data.

A. Air conditioning 
B. Security tokens 
C. Fire alarms 
D. Security policy","The correct answer is B.
 A logical (or technical) control is one used for identification, authentication, and authorization. It can be embedded inside an operating system, application, or database management system. A security token (such as RSA’s SecureID) can provide a number that changes on a recurring basis that a user must provide during authentication, or it may provide a built-in number on a USB device that must be attached during authentication. A physical control is something, well, physical in nature, such as a lock or key or maybe a guard."
17,D,D,1,"A is incorrect because the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), also known as the Orange Book, was created by the Department of Defense (DoD) and defines and provides guidance on evaluating access controls within a system.

18,A,A,1,B is incorrect because black-box testing is designed to simulate the external threat. Black-box testing takes the most amount of time to complete because it means a thorough romp through the five stages of an attack (and removes any preconceived notions of what to look for) and is usually the most expensive option. Another drawback to this type of test is that it focuses solely on the threat outside the organization and does not take into account any trusted users on the inside.,"C is incorrect because a hat color refers to the attacker. True, the client is hiring a white hat in this instance to perform the test; however, the hat does not equate to the test. White hats are the “good guys”—ethical hackers hired by a customer for the specific goal of testing and improving security. White hats don’t use their knowledge and skills without prior consent.","D is incorrect because this question refers to the test itself, not the type of attacker. Black hats are the “bad guys” and are otherwise known as crackers. They illegally use their skills either for personal gain or for malicious intent, seeking to steal or destroy data or to deny access to resources and systems. Black hats do not ask for permission or consent.","As part of the preparation phase for a pen test you are participating in, the client relays their intent to discover security flaws and possible remediation. They seem particularly concerned about internal threats from the user base. Which of the following best describes the test type the client is looking for? 
A. Gray box 
B. Black box 
C. White hat 
D. Black hat","The correct answer is A.
 Once again, this is a play on words the exam will throw at you. Note the question is asking about a test type, not the attacker. Reviewing CEH documentation, you’ll see there are three types of tests—white, black, and gray—with each designed to test a specific threat. White tests the internal threat of a knowledgeable systems administrator or an otherwise elevated privilege level user. Black tests external threats with no knowledge of the target. Gray tests the average internal user threat to expose potential security problems inside the network."
19,D,D,1,"A is incorrect because the reconnaissance phase is all about gaining knowledge and information on a target. In reconnaissance, you’re learning about the target itself—for example, what system types they may have in use, what their operating hours are, whether they use a shredder, and what personal information about their employees is available. Think of reconnaissance as the background information on a good character in a novel; it may not be completely necessary to know before you read the action scenes, but it sure makes it easier to understand why the character behaves in a certain manner during the conflict phase of the book. Setting up zombie systems goes far beyond the boundaries of gathering information.","B is incorrect because this phase is where attackers attempt to conceal their success and avoid detection by security professionals. This can involve removing or altering log files, concealing files with via hidden attributes or directories, and using tunneling protocols to communicate with the system.","C is incorrect because in this phase attacks are leveled against the targets identified during the scanning and enumeration phase. Key words to look for in identifying this phase are the attacks themselves (such as buffer overflow and SQL injection). Finally, be careful about questions relating to elevating privileges. Sometimes this is counted as its own phase, so pay close attention to the question’s wording in choosing your answer.","In which phase of the attack would a hacker set up and configure “zombie” machines? 
A. Reconnaissance 
B. Covering tracks 
C. Gaining access 
D. Maintaining access","The correct answer is D.
 Zombies are basically machines hackers commandeer to do their work for them. If the attacker is really good, the owners of the zombie machines don’t even know their machines have been drafted into the war. There are a bajillion methods for maintaining access on a machine you’ve already compromised, and maintaining that access does not necessarily mean the system will be used as a zombie—you could, for example, simply want to check in from time to time to see what new juicy information the user has decided to leave in a file or folder for you, or to check on new logins, credentials, and so on. However, configuring zombie systems definitely belongs in this phase."
20,C,C,1,"A, B, and D are incorrect because all these are perfectly acceptable security policy entries. Exceptions to the policy and what happens to you should you decide not to follow the policy are expected entries. Also, supporting documents—such as various procedures, standards, and guidelines—are always referenced in the policy.",,,"Which of the following should not be included in a security policy? 
A. Policy exceptions 
B. Details on noncompliance disciplinary actions 
C. Technical details and procedures 
D. Supporting document references","The correct answer is C.
 The whole policy/standard/procedure/guideline thing can get confusing sometimes. A policy is a high-level document that doesn’t get down and dirty into technical details/specifications and is intended to improve awareness. Policies are mandatory, generally short, and easy to understand, providing everyone with the rules of the road. Standards are mandatory rules designed to support a policy, and they must include one or more specifications for hardware, software, or behavior. Procedures are step- by-step instructions for completing a task. Guidelines are not mandatory but rather are recommendations for accomplishing a goal or on how to act in a given situation."
21,A,A,1,B is incorrect because vulnerability management isn’t about responding to incidents, it’s about identifying and eradicating vulnerabilities before an incident can occur.,C is incorrect because change management involves implementing procedures or technologies to identify and implement required changes within a computer system.,"Which of the following is best defined as a set of processes used to identify, analyze, prioritize, and resolve security incidents? 
A. Incident management 
B. Vulnerability management 
C. Change management 
D. Patch management","The correct answer is A.
 Admittedly, this one is fairly easy—or at least it should be. Incident management is the process of dealing with incidents and generally always has the same features/ steps—identify the problem or root cause, analyze and research the issue, contain the malicious effort, eradicate the effort, and resolve any damage caused. ECC defines the process as having eight steps: 1. Preparation, 2. Detection and Analysis, 3. Classification/Prioritization, 4. Notification, 5. Containment, 6. Forensic Investigation, 7. Eradication and Recovery, and 8. Post-incident Activities. The incident response team (IRT) is charged with handling this process."
22,D,D,1,"A and B are incorrect because regardless of reporting, you should immediately stop testing. Anything you do after discovery not only could destroy evidence but actually put you at risk. Who’s to say you didn’t put the item in question on the system, or by your action cause it to be there? Rest assured the defense attorney will posit that argument, should it come to that.","C is incorrect because you’ve already agreed to perform this work, and refusing to speak with the client isn’t helping anything at all. Again, this needs to be addressed in the scope agreement up front, so there should be no surprises. It may well be that an employee has illegal stuff on their system, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the organization is complicit.",,"During an assessment, your pen test team discovers child porn on a system. Which of the following is the appropriate response? 
A. Continue testing and report findings at the out-brief. 
B. Continue testing but report findings to the business owners. 
C. Cease testing immediately and refuse to continue work for the client. 
D. Cease testing immediately and contact authorities.","The correct answer is D.
 I hesitated to add this question, for reasons that are obvious and some that aren’t, but in the interest of covering everything, I felt I must. First and foremost, in the real world, discovery of something that you think might be illegal activity puts you and your team in a very, very tricky spot. Should you accuse fill-in-the-blank of a crime and involve the authorities, you could be setting yourself up for lawsuits and all sorts of trouble. On the other hand, if you ignore it, you might be found complicit, or at the very least negligent. In the real world, the answer is to make sure your scope agreement advises you and the client of your duty regarding potential criminal activity found during the scope of your investigation. No guessing is allowed—it better be iron-clad evidence, obvious to all, or you’re in a world of hurt. Finally, what potentially illegal activity you discover may determine your response regardless of the ROE (rules of engagement). If you discover child porn, you could be guilty of a crime for not reporting it, which isn’t necessarily true for many other crimes. For example, if you witness someone breaking into a house across your street, or were performing a pen test and reasonably suspected someone had already compromised the network, you are not compelled by law, in most states, to notify authorities. However, if you witness bodily harm, you likely would be compelled by law in most states. Speaking purely academically, it’s fairly clear cut and will be so on your exam. In the real world, the true answer is to know the laws regarding your testing very well, and make sure your team has a good lawyer. In this example, however, the choices present make this relatively easy. ECC wants ethical hackers to report any illegal activity they find. Period. Possession of child porn is a crime no matter what, so again in this particular case, stop your testing and report it to the authorities."
23,A,A,1,"B is incorrect because this describes the management network zone. This zone is usually cordoned off specifically for infrastructure and management traffic. For obvious reasons, it’s highly secured. Look for “VLAN” and “IPSec” as keywords for this zone.","C is incorrect because this describes the DMZ. The demilitarized zone in military parlance refers to a section of land between two adversarial parties where there are no weapons and no fighting. The idea is you could see an adversary coming across and have time to work up a defense. In networking, the idea is the same: it’s a controlled buffer network between you and the uncontrolled chaos of the Internet. And keep in mind DMZs aren’t just between the Internet and a network; they can be anywhere an organization decides they want or need a buffer—inside or outside various internets and intranets. DMZ networks provide great opportunity for good security measures but can also sometimes become an Achilles’ heel when too much trust is put into their creation and maintenance.","D is incorrect because this describes the production network zone (PNZ). The PNZ is a very restricted zone that strictly controls direct access from uncontrolled zones. The PNZ supports functions and actions that must have strict access control. As an aside, the PNZ is not designed to hold users.","Which of the following best describes an intranet zone? 
A. A zone with few heavy security restrictions 
B. A highly secured zone, usually employing VLANs and encrypted communication channels 
C. A controlled buffer network between public and private networks 
D. A very restricted zone with no users","The correct answer is A.
 An intranet can be thought of, for testing purposes, as your own happy little networking safe space. It’s protected from outside attacks and interference by the DMZ and all the layers of security on the outside. Internally, you don’t assign loads of heavy security restrictions, because, as explained in the security versus usability discussion in the CEH All-in-One Exam Guide, Fifth Edition, as security increases, usability and functionality decrease. If your organization’s users are on the intranet, you want them as productive as possible, right?"
24,"B, D","B, D",1,"A and C are both incorrect because they list the terms backward. Threats take advantage of vulnerabilities and exploit them, not the other way around.",,,"A machine in your environment uses an open X-server to allow remote access. The X-server access control is disabled, allowing connections from almost anywhere and with little to no authentication measures. Which of the following are true statements regarding this situation? (Choose all that apply.) 
A. An external vulnerability can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server threat. 
B. An external threat can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server vulnerability. 
C. An internal vulnerability can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server threat. 
D. An internal threat can take advantage of the misconfigured X-server vulnerability.","The correct answer is B, D.
 This is an easy one because all you have to understand are the definitions of threat and vulnerability. A threat is any agent, circumstance, or situation that could potentiality cause harm or loss to an IT asset. In this case, the implication is the threat is an individual (hacker) either inside or outside the network. A vulnerability is any weakness, such as a software flaw or logic design, that could be exploited by a threat to cause damage to an asset. In both these answers, the vulnerability—the access controls on the X-server are not in place—can be exploited by the threat, whether internal or external."
25,B,B,1,"A is incorrect because TTP refers to tactics, techniques, and procedures, which are the patterns of activity and methods associated with specific adversaries.",C is incorrect because APT refers to advanced persistent threat—a threat actor who gains unauthorized access to a resource and remains undetected for an extended period.,"D is incorrect because ABI refers to adversary behavioral identification, which involves efforts in identifying the common methods and techniques followed by adversaries.","Which of the following best describes forensic evidence indicating a potential intrusion or malicious activity? 
A. TTP 
B. IOC 
C. APT 
D. ABI","The correct answer is B.
 An indicator of compromise (IOC) describes the little clues and artifacts left behind on a resource that can indicate malicious intrusion or activity. Their existence in and of themselves might not mean anything; however, searching for known IOCs in your network can be a valuable security exercise to undertake. IOCs can come in many forms, some of which include privileged user activity anomalies, strange DNS requests, conflicting port application traffic, unusual registry or system file changes, and suspect web traffic and unusual network activity."
26,B,B,1,,,,"Which header field is used to reassemble fragmented IP packets? 
A. Destination address 
B.IP identification 
C.Don’t fragment bit 
D.ToS field","The correct answer is B.
 The destination address is used as the address to send messages to. The don’t fragment bit is used to tell network devices not to fragment the packet. The Type of Service (ToS) field can be used to perform quality of service. The IP identification field is used to identify fragments of the same packet, as they would all have the same IP identification number."

A. Cross-site scripting 
B.Command injection 
C.SQL injection 
D.XML external entity injection","The correct answer is C.
 A SQL injection attack makes use of SQL queries, which can include logic that may alter the flow of the application. In the example provided, the intent is to force the result of the SQL query to always return a true. It is quoted the way it is to escape the existing query already in place in the application. None of the other attacks use a syntax that looks like the example."
28,C,C,1,,,,"What method might you use to successfully get malware onto a mobile device? 
A. Through the Apple Store or Google Play Store 
B.External storage on an Android 
C.Third-party app store 
D.Jailbreaking","The correct answer is C.
 The Apple App Store and the Google Play Store are controlled by Apple and Google. It’s not impossible to get malware onto mobile devices that way, but it’s very difficult because apps get run through a vetting process. While some Android devices will support external storage, it’s not an effective way to get malware onto a smartphone or other mobile device. Jailbreaking can lead to malware being installed but it’s not the means to get malware onto a mobile device. Third-party app stores can be a good means to get malware onto mobile devices because some third-party app stores don’t vet apps that are submitted."
29,B,B,1,,,,"What protocol is used to take a destination IP address and get a packet to a destination on the local network? 
A. DHCP 
B.ARP 
C.DNS 
D.RARP","The correct answer is B.
 DHCP is used to get IP configuration to endpoints. DNS is used to resolve a hostname to an IP address and vice versa. RARP is the reverse address protocol used to take a MAC address and resolve it to an IP address. ARP is used to resolve an IP address to a MAC address. Communication on a local network requires the use of a MAC address. The IP address is used to get to systems off the local network."

A. Heap spraying 
B.SQL injection 
C.Buffer overflow 
D.Slowloris attack","The correct answer is C.
 Heap spraying uses dynamically allocated space to store attack code. A slowloris attack is used to hold open web server connection buffers. A SQL injection will be used to inject SQL queries to the database server. A buffer overflow sends more data into the application than space has been allocated for."

D./20","The correct answer is B.
 A /23 network would be 255.255.254.0. A /22 would be 255.255.252. A /20 would be 255.255.240.0. Only a /21 would give you a 255.255.248.0 subnet mask."
32,C,C,1,,,,"What is the primary difference between a worm and a virus? 
A. A worm uses polymorphic code 
B. A virus uses polymorphic code 
C. A worm can self-propagate 
D. A virus can self-propagate","The correct answer is C.
 Both worms and viruses could be written to use polymorphic code, which means they could modify what they look like as they propagate. A worm, though, could self-propagate. It’s the one distinction between worms and viruses. Viruses require some intervention on the part of the user to propagate and execute."
33,A,A,1,,,,"How would you calculate risk? 
A. Probability * loss 
B.Probability * mitigation factor 
C.(Loss + mitigation factor) * (loss/probability) 
D.Probability * mitigation factor","The correct answer is A.
 Risk is the probability of the occurrence of an event multiplied by the dollar value of loss. There is no mitigation factor that is quantified so it could be put into a risk ­calculation."
34,B,B,1,,,,"How does an evil twin attack work? 
A. Phishing users for credentials 
B.Spoofing an SSID 
C.Changing an SSID 
D.Injecting four-way handshakes","The correct answer is B.
 An evil twin attack uses an access point masquerading to be the point of connection for stations trying to connect to a legitimate wireless network. Stations reach out to make connections to this access point masquerading as another access point. While you may phish for credentials as part of an evil twin attack, credential phishing is not how evil twin attacks work. SSIDs don’t get changed as part of an evil twin attack, meaning no SSID that exists will become another SSID.
 Injecting four-way handshakes won’t do much, since four- way assumes both ends are communicating, so the injection of a full communication stream will get ignored."
35,C,C,1,,,,"In order to remove malware in the network before it gets to the endpoint, you would use which of the following? 
A. Antivirus 
B.Application layer gateway 
C.Unified threat management appliance 
D.Stateful firewall","The correct answer is C.
 Antivirus solutions are used on endpoints or maybe on email servers. Stateful firewalls add in the ability to factor in the state of the connection—new, related, established. An Application layer gateway knows about Application layer protocols. A unified threat management appliance adds additional capabilities on top of firewall functions, including antivirus."
36,A,A,1,,,,"What is the purpose of a security policy? 
A. Providing high-level guidance on the role of security 
B.Providing specific direction to security workers 
C.Increasing the bottom line of a company 
D.Aligning standards and practices","The correct answer is A.
 Standards and practices should be derived from a security policy, which is the high- level guidance on the role of security within an organization. Security does not generally increase the bottom line of a company. Policies are not for providing specific directions, which would be the role of procedures."
37,B. Base64 encoding takes non-printable characters and encodes them in a way that they can be rendered in text. Encryption would generally render text unreadable to people.

A. Mail exchanger records for domain.com 
B.Name server records for domain.com 
C.Caching name server for domain.com 
D.IP address for the hostname ns","The correct answer is B.
 Mail exchanger records would be identified as MX records. A name server record is identified with the tag NS. While an enterprise may have one or even several caching name servers, the caching name server wouldn’t be said to belong to the domain since it doesn’t have any domain identification associated with it."
39,C,C,1,,,,"What technique would you ideally use to get all of the hostnames associated with a domain? 
A. DNS query 
B.Zone copy 
C.Zone transfer 
D.Recursive request","The correct answer is C.
 A DNS query can be used to identify an IP address from a hostname or vice versa. You could potentially use a brute-force technique to identify hostnames, though you may not get everything using that method. A recursive request is common from a caching server to get an authoritative response. The term for getting all the contents of the zone is a zone transfer."
40,A,A,1,,,,"If you were to notice operating system commands inside a DNS request while looking at a packet capture, what might you be looking at? 
A. Tunneling attack 
B.DNS amplification 
C.DNS recursion 
D.XML entity injection","The correct answer is A.
 Tunneling attacks can be used to hide one protocol inside another. This may be used to send operating system commands using a tunnel system. A DNS amplification attack is where a small DNS request results in much larger responses sent to the target. DNS recur- sion is used to look up information from DNS servers. An XML entity injection attack is a web-based attack and wouldn’t be found inside a DNS request."
41,D,D,1,,,,"What would be the purpose of running a ping sweep? 
A. You want to identify responsive hosts without a port scan. 
B.You want to use something that is light on network traffic. 
C.You want to use a protocol that may be allowed through the firewall. 
D.All of the above.","The correct answer is D.
 There may be several reasons for performing a ping sweep. You likely want to identify responsive hosts on the network segment you are targeting. You may not, though, want to use a full port scan. ICMP is a lightweight protocol and there is a chance it will be allowed through the firewall, since it’s used for troubleshooting and diagnostics."

A. Python interpreter is slow. 
B.Python interpreter may not be available. 
C.There is inadequate library support. 
D.Python is a hard language to learn.","The correct answer is B.
 Python interpreters may be considered to be slower to execute than a compiled program, however the difference is negligible and generally speed of execution isn’t much of a con- cern when it comes to malware. Python is not a hard language to learn and there are a lot of community-developed libraries. One challenge, though, is that you may need a Python interpreter, unless you go through the step of getting a Python compiler and compiling your script. Windows systems wouldn’t commonly have a Python interpreter installed."

C.Traffic just to 192.168.10.5 
D.All traffic other than from 192.168.86.5","The correct answer is B.
 The expression host 192.168.10.5 is BPF indicating that tcpdump should only capture packets to and from 192.168.10.5. If you wanted to only get it to or from, you would need to modify host with src or dest."

D.Key revocation","The correct answer is C.
 Certificates can be revoked but that’s not what Diffie-Hellman is used for. Key man­ agement is a much broader topic than what Diffie-Hellman is used for. Diffie-Hellman is used for key exchange. It is a process that allows parties to an encrypted conversation to mutually derive the same key starting with the same base value."
46,D,D,1,,,,"Which social engineering principle may allow a phony call from the help desk to be effective? 
A. Social proof 
B.Imitation 
C.Scarcity

47,D,D,1,,,,"How do you authenticate with SNMPv1? 
A. Username/password 
B.Hash 
C.Public string 
D.Community string","The correct answer is D.
 SNMPv3 implemented username and password authentication. With version 1, you used a cleartext community string. SNMP doesn’t use hashes and while the word “pub- lic” is often used as a community string, a public string is not a way to authenticate with SNMPv1."

 When an ARP response is sent without a corresponding ARP request, it’s an unexpected or unnecessary message, so it is a gratuitous ARP."
50,D,D,1,,,,"What are the three times that are typically stored as part of file metadata? 
A. Moves, adds, changes 
B.Modified, accessed, deleted 
C.Moved, accessed, changed 
D.Modified, accessed, created","The correct answer is D.
 There are three date and time stamps commonly used in file metadata. When the file is created, that moment is stored. When a file is accessed by a user, that moment is stored. When a file is modified, that moment is stored. Accessed is not the same as modified since accessing a file could be read-only. You could open a file, expecting to modify it but not ending up doing the modification. The access time still changes. While moves, adds, and changes may sometimes be referred to as MAC like modified, accessed, and created, those are not tasks associated with file times."
51,C,C,1,,,,"Which of these is a reason to use an exploit against a local vulnerability? 
A. Pivoting 
B.Log manipulation 
C.Privilege escalation 
D.Password collection","The correct answer is C.
 Local vulnerabilities are used against applications that are not listening on the network. This means they require you to be “local” to the machine and not remote. In other words, you have to be logged in somehow. A local vulnerability would not be used to collect pass- words since you don’t need a vulnerability to do that. Similarly, you don’t need to make use of a vulnerability to manipulate logs or to pivot. Most of those would require you to have elevated permissions, though. A local vulnerability may be exploited to get you those elevated permissions."
52,A,A,1,,,,"What principle is used to demonstrate that a signed message came from the owner of the key that signed it? 
A. Non-repudiation 
B.Non-verifiability 
C.Integrity 
D.Authority","The correct answer is A.
 Integrity is part of the CIA triad but isn’t the principle that ties a signed message back to the subject of the signing certificate. Non-verifiability is nonsense and authority isn’t rel- evant here. Instead, non-repudiation means someone can’t say they didn’t send a message if it was signed with their key and that key was in their possession and password-protected."
53,D,D,1,,,,"What is a viable approach to protecting against tailgaiting? 
A. Biometrics 
B.Badge access 
C.Phone verification 
D.Man traps","The correct answer is D.
 Biometrics and badge access are forms of physical access control. Phone verification could possibly be used as a way of verifying identity but it won’t protect against tailgating. A man trap, however, will protect against tailgating because a man trap only allows one person in at a time."
54,B,B,1,,,,"Why is bluesnarfing potentially more dangerous than bluejacking? 
A. Bluejacking sends while bluesnarfing receives. 
B.Bluejacking receives while bluesnarfing sends. 
C.Bluejacking installs keyloggers. 
D.Bluesnarfing installs keyloggers.","The correct answer is B.
 Bluesnarfing is an attack that connects to a Bluetooth device in order to grab data from that device. Bluejacking can be used to send information to a Bluetooth device that is receiving from the attacker, such as a text message. Neither of these attacks install keylog- gers. The victim device sends information to the attacker in a bluesnarfing attack."

56,A,A,1,,,,"Which of these devices would not be considered part of the Internet of Things? 
A. Smartphone 
B.Thermostat 
C.Light bulb 
D.Set-top cable box","The correct answer is A.
 A thermostat is an embedded device without a traditional user interface. A light bulb would have no user interface, even if it has network capabilities. A set-top cable box would have a custom interface and not a general-purpose one. The only device here that is a general-purpose computing platform with a traditional user interface—screen and keyboard—is the smartphone, so it isn’t part of the IoT."
57,D,D,1,,,,"If you wanted a lightweight protocol to send real-time data over, which of these would you use? 
A. TCP 
B.HTTP 
C.ICMP 
D.UDP","The correct answer is D.
 TCP uses a three-way handshake, which is fairly heavyweight. HTTP uses TCP and adds more on top of it. ICMP is used for control messages. UDP has very little overhead and is commonly used for real-time data transport."

 While Microsoft Azure and Google Compute have storage capabilities, they aren’t storage as a service solutions. Drop leaf is a type of table. Dropbox is a storage as a service solution. The only one listed here that is storage as a solution is iCloud, which is Apple’s cloud storage platform."
60,B,B,1,,,,"The UDP headers contain which of the following fields? 
A. Source address, destination address, checksum, length 
B.Destination port, source port, checksum, length 
C.Flags, source port, destination port, checksum 
D.Length, checksum, flags, address","The correct answer is B.
 The IP headers include addresses. UDP headers use ports. TCP headers use flags, but UDP headers do not. The UDP headers have the source and destination port fields along with checksum and length."
61,C,C,1,,,,"What are the three steps in the TCP handshake as described by the flags set? 
A. SYN, SYN/URG, RST 
B.RST, SYN, ACK 
C.SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK 
D.SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK/URG","The correct answer is C.
 The three-way handshake is used to establish a connection. The first message has the SYN flag set and includes the sequence number. The response from the server has the ACK flag set for the SYN message that was sent from the client. The acknowledgment number is set. Additionally, in the same message, the server sends its own SYN flag and sequence number. The client then responds with an ACK message. So, the sequence is SYN, SYN/ACK, and ACK."
62,D,D,1,,,,"Which of these protocols would be used to communicate with an IoT device? 
A. ICMP 
B.SMTP 
C.Telnet 
D.HTTP","The correct answer is D.
 While ICMP may be used as part of passing control messages in case of errors in the network, it wouldn’t be used between the IoT device and a server. SMTP is an email protocol that also wouldn’t be used. Telnet is a cleartext protocol used to gain command- line access to a system. HTTP would commonly be used to pass messages between a controlling server and an IoT device."
63,D,D,1,,,,"Which network topology are you most likely to run across in a large enterprise network? 
A. Ring topology 
B.Bus topology 
C.Full mesh 
D.Star-bus hybrid","The correct answer is D.
 Ring networks were once common but are much less so now. You may find a ring network in a service provider network today. A bus topology is best suited for a smaller network. Full mesh isn’t a very common topology, in part because of the expense and complexity it brings. A star-bus hybrid would be common. An enterprise would use multiple switches that were all connected to one another over a bus, while all the endpoints would connect to the switch in a star topology."
64,B,B,1,,,,"If you were to see the subnet mask 255.255.252.0, what CIDR notation (prefix) would you use to indicate the same thing? 
A. /23 
B./22 
C./21 
D./20","The correct answer is B.
 A /23 network would be 255.255.254.0. A /21 would be 255.255.248. A /20 would be 255.255.240.0. Only a /22 would give you a 255.255.252.0 subnet mask."
65,C,C,1,,,,"Which of these addresses would be considered a private address (RFC 1918 address)? 
A. 172.128.10.5 
B.9.10.10.7 
C.172.20.128.240 
D.250.28.17.10","The correct answer is C.
 The RFC 1918 address blocks are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. The only address listed that fits into one of those address blocks is 172.20.128.240. The address block is 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255."
66,A,A,1,,,,"If you were looking for the definitive documentation on a protocol, what would you consult? 
A. Request for Comments 
B.Manual pages 
C.Standards 
D.IEEE","The correct answer is A.
 Manual pages provide documentation for commands and programs. IEEE is the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which does manage some protocols but isn’t documentation itself. Standards on the Internet are actually uncommon and only happen after a very long period of time. The best place to find definitive documentation about protocols seen on the Internet is in the Request for Comments (RFC) documents."
67,D,D,1,,,,"The PDU for TCP is called a 
A. Packet 
B.Datagram 
C.Frame 
D.Segment","The correct answer is D.
 At the Network layer, the PDU is a packet. The Network layer is IP. At the Data Link layer, the PDU is a frame. Commonly, the protocol would be Ethernet there. UDP uses datagram as the PDU. TCP uses segment for the PDU."
68,B,B,1,,,,"Which header field is used to reassemble fragmented IP packets? 
A. Source address 
B.IP identification 
C.Don’t fragment bit 
D.Acknowledgment field","The correct answer is B.
 The source address is used as the address to send back to on the response, making it the destination address. The don’t fragment bit is used to tell network devices not to fragment the packet. The acknowledgment field is part of the TCP header and not the IP header. The IP identification field is used to identify fragments of the same packet, as they would all have the same IP identification number."
69,C,C,1,,,,"Which protocol is necessary to enable the functionality of traceroute? 
A. HTTP 
B.SNMP 
C.ICMP 
D.IP","The correct answer is C.
 The traceroute program uses UDP messages with the time to live field starting at 1. This is incremented for each hop in the network until the destination is reached. Each device would send an ICMP time exceeded in transit message back to indicate the TTL had expired. The source of that message indicates the address of the network hop. On Windows systems, tracert uses ICMP echo request messages, also incrementing the time to live value. Because of these two factors, traceroute requires ICMP to work."
70,D,D,1,,,,"What is a MAC address used for? 
A. Addressing systems over a VPN 
B.Addressing systems through a tunnel 
C.Addressing systems over TCP 
D.Addressing systems on the local network","The correct answer is D.
 Systems over a VPN may use a MAC address but they may also use IP addresses. The same would be true for a tunnel. Using TCP, we would use ports for addressing. On the local network, the MAC address is used."
71,C,C,1,,,,"To remove malware from the network before it gets to the endpoint, you would use which of the following? 
A. Packet filter 
B.Application layer gateway 
C.Unified threat management appliance 
D.Stateful firewall","The correct answer is C.
 Packet filters are used to make block/allow decisions based on header data like source and destination address and port. Stateful firewalls add in the ability to factor in the state of the connection—new, related, established. An Application layer gateway knows about Application layer protocols. A unified threat management appliance adds additional capabilities on top of firewall functions, including antivirus."
72,D,D,1,,,,"If you were on a client engagement and discovered that you left an external hard drive with essential data on it at home, which security principle would you be violating? 
A. Confidentiality 
B.Integrity 
C.Non-repudiation 
D.Availability","The correct answer is D.
 Confidentiality is about making sure secrets are kept secret. Integrity makes sure that data isn’t altered accidentally or by an unauthorized agent. Non-repudiation makes sure someone can’t say a message didn’t originate with them if it came from their identity. Availability means making sure data is where it needs to be when it should be there. This includes services as well."
73,A,A,1,,,,"How would you calculate risk? 
A. Probability * loss value 
B.Probability * mitigation factor 
C.(Loss value + mitigation factor) * (loss value/probability) 
D.Probability * mitigation factor","The correct answer is A.
 Risk is the probability of the occurrence of an event multiplied by the dollar value of loss. There is no mitigation factor that is quantified, so it could be put into a risk calculation."
74,D,D,1,,,,"Which of the following is one factor of a defense in depth approach to network design? 
A. Switches 
B.Using Linux on the desktop 
C.Optical cable connections 
D.Access control lists on routers","The correct answer is D.
 Switches and optical cable connections can certainly be part of a network design, but in and of themselves they don’t add any security features. You may use Linux on the desktop, but without more of a strategy for patch and vulnerability management, Linux is no better than other operating systems. Access control lists on routers can add an additional layer of security, especially when combined with other elements like firewalls and intrusion detection systems."
75,B,B,1,,,,"How would you ensure that confidentiality is implemented in an organization? 
A. Watchdog processes 
B.Encryption 
C.Cryptographic hashes 
D.Web servers","The correct answer is B.
 Confidentiality is keeping secret information secret, which means unauthorized users can’t access it. Encryption is a good way to keep unauthorized users from data because in order to get to the data, they need to have the key. Watchdog processes are used to ensure that programs remain running. Cryptographic hashes are used to verify the integrity of data. Web servers are used to serve up information."
76,C,C,1,,,,"An intrusion detection system can perform which of the following functions? 
A. Block traffic 
B.Filter traffic based on headers 
C.Generate alerts on traffic 
D.Log system messages","The correct answer is C.
 Firewalls are used to block traffic into a network, though an intrusion prevention system will also block traffic. A packet filtering firewall uses header information, such as source and destination address and port, to determine whether to allow traffic into the network. Syslog and the Windows event subsystem can be used to log system messages. Intrusion detection systems can be used to generate alerts on traffic."
77,D,D,1,,,,"Which of these would be an example of a loss of integrity? 
A. User making changes to a file and saving it 
B.Bad blocks flagged on disk 
C.Credit cards passed in cleartext 
D.Memory failures causing disk drivers to run incorrectly","The correct answer is D.
 If a user makes a change to a file and saves it, that’s an intentional act and the data is what the user expects and wants. If the disk drive has flagged bad blocks on the disk, the drive won’t write any data out to those blocks, so there will be no loss of integrity. Credit cards passed in cleartext would be a violation of confidentiality. Memory failures, though, could cause a loss of data integrity, even in the case of writing data to the drive. The corrupted data in memory could be written to disk. Also, memory failures may cause issues with the disk driver, which may also cause data corruption."
78,A,A,1,,,,"What would you use a security information event manager for? 
A. Aggregating and providing search for log data 
B.Managing security projects 
C.Escalating security events 
D.Storing open-source intelligence","The correct answer is A.
 Security information event managers are used to aggregate event data, such as log information. Once the data has been aggregated, it can be searched and correlated. Even though it’s called an event manager, it isn’t used to manage security projects, nor is it used to escalate security events. Other tools can be used to gather and store open-source intelligence."
79,C,C,1,,,,"Why is it important to store system logs remotely? 
A. Local systems can’t handle it. 
B.Bandwidth is faster than disks. 
C.Attackers might delete local logs. 
D.It will defend against attacks.","The correct answer is C.
 Commonly, system logs are stored on the system that generated the log message. Certainly local systems can handle the logs they have generated. Log messages don’t typically consume a lot of space at an individual message level, so bandwidth isn’t a problem. Transmitting over a network is generally not faster than moving data within local disks. System logs can be used in identifying attacks, but the logs won’t defend against attacks. However, if an attacker does compromise a system, the attacker may delete the local logs because they could get access to them."
80,B,B,1,,,,"What would be necessary for a TCP conversation to be considered ESTABLISHED by a stateful firewall? 
A. Final acknowledgment message 
B.Three-way handshake complete 
C.Sequence numbers aligned 
D.SYN message received","The correct answer is B.
 In TCP, a three-way handshake is used to synchronize sequence numbers and establish a connection. While the sequence numbers are shared, they wouldn’t be called aligned, which might suggest that each end was using the same sequence number. A SYN message is part of the three-way handshake, but it is not sufficient to establish a connection. Option A, “Final acknowledgment message,” is ambiguous. It could refer to the acknowledgment to a FIN message, closing the connection."
81,A,A,1,,,,"What is the purpose of a security policy? 
A. To provide high-level guidance on the role of security 
B.To provide specific direction to security workers 
C.To increase the bottom line of a company 
D.To align standards and practices","The correct answer is A.
 Standards and practices should be derived from a security policy, which is the high- level guidance on the role of security within an organization. Security does not generally increase the bottom line of a company. Policies are not for providing specific directions, which would be the role of procedures."
82,C,C,1,,,,"What additional properties does the Parkerian hexad offer over the CIA triad? 
A. Confidentiality, awareness, authenticity 
B.Utility, awareness, possession 
C.Utility, possession, authenticity 
D.Possession, control, authenticity","The correct answer is C.
 The Parkerian hexad takes the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the CIA triad and adds utility, possession (or control), and authenticity."
83,D,D,1,,,,"What important event can be exposed by enabling auditing? 
A. System shutdown 
B.Service startup 
C.Package installation 
D.User login","The correct answer is D.
 While system shutdown, service startup, and package installation may be events that are logged, they are generally logged by normal system logging. Auditing functions are different between Windows and Linux/Unix, but audit systems for both will generate logs when a user logs into a system."
84,B,B,1,,,,"What can an intrusion prevention system do that an intrusion detection system can’t? 
A. Generate alerts 
B.Block or reject network traffic 
C.Complete the three-way handshake to bogus messages 
D.Log packets","The correct answer is B.
 While an intrusion prevention system can generate alerts, so can an intrusion detection system. Both systems may also be able to log packets, as needed. A bogus message likely wouldn’t result in a completed three-way handshake, and the handshake shouldn’t be completed anyway. An intrusion prevention system can, however, block or reject network traffic, while an intrusion detection system can’t."
85,A,A,1,,,,"Which of these is an example of an application layer gateway? 
A. Web application firewall 
B.Runtime application self-protection 
C.Java applet 
D.Intrusion prevention system","The correct answer is A.
 Runtime application self-protection is a plug-in used on an application server to prevent bad messages from impacting the application. A Java applet is an implementation of a Java program. An intrusion prevention system is used to detect and block potential intrusions. A web application firewall, however, makes decisions based on Application layer traffic and will either allow or block that traffic. This makes it an Application layer gateway."
86,C,C,1,,,,"Which information would a packet filter use to make decisions about what traffic to allow into the network? 
A. HTTP REQUEST message 
B.Ethernet type 
C.UDP source port 
D.SNMP OID","The correct answer is C.
 A packet filter would use layer 2/3/4 headers to make decisions. An HTTP REQUEST message is at the Application layer (layer 7). Ethernet type isn’t used to make decisions in a packet filter. SNMP OID is also an Application layer message. A packet filter would, though, use source or destination ports, potentially, to make decisions about allowing or blocking a packet."
87,C,C,1,,,,"Which of the following products might be used as an intrusion detection system? 
A. Elastic Stack 
B.Prewikka 
C.Snort 
D.Snorby","The correct answer is C.
 ElasticStack is an implementation of a security information event manager. Prewikka can be used along with an intrusion detection system as a dashboard. Snorby is an auxiliary program used with Snort. Snort is an intrusion detection program."
88,D,D,1,,,,"Which of these isn’t an example of an attack that compromises integrity? 
A. Buffer overflow 
B.Man in the middle 
C.Heap spraying 
D.Watering hole","The correct answer is D.
 A buffer overflow attack is used to execute attacker-supplied code by altering the return address in the stack. A man in the middle attack can be used to intercept and potentially alter a conversation between two systems. A heap spraying attack sends a lot of data into the heap to overwrite what’s there. A watering hole attack does not compromise integrity since its purpose is to introduce malware to a system. The malware might eventually compromise integrity, but the watering hole attack itself does not."
89,B,B,1,,,,"What type of attack is a compromise of availability? 
A. Watering hole 
B.DoS 
C.Phishing 
D.Buffer overflow","The correct answer is B.
 A watering hole attack looks to compromise a system that visits a website. A phishing attack looks to gather information from victims, potentially by compromising the victim’s system. A buffer overflow attack tries to introduce code provided by the attacker. A denial of service attack, however, has the intention of making a service unavailable for users."
90,C,C,1,,,,"If you were implementing defense in breadth, what might you do? 
A. Install multiple firewalls 
B.Install intrusion detection systems 
C.Introduce a DevSecOps culture 
D.Ensure policies are up to date","The correct answer is C.
 Installing multiple firewalls and intrusion detection systems and ensuring that policies are up to date are all elements of a defense in depth approach. Introducing a DevSecOps culture may be an attempt to reduce the number of vulnerabilities and also get them resolved more quickly. As such, it might be considered defense in breadth."
91,B,B,1,,,,"If you were checking on the IP addresses for a company in France, what RIR would you be checking with for details? 
A. ARIN 
B.RIPE 
C.AfriNIC 
D.LACNIC","The correct answer is B.
 France is in Europe, and as such, it falls under the jurisdiction of RIPE. ARIN handles North America. AfriNIC handles Africa, and LACNIC handles Latin America and parts of the Caribbean."
92,D,D,1,,,,"You need to identify all Excel spreadsheets available from the company Example, Inc., whose domain is example.com. What search query would you use? 
A. site:example.com files:pdf 
B.site:excel files:xls 
C.domain:example.com filetype:xls 
D.site:example.com filetype:xls","The correct answer is D.
 The keyword site indicates the site (or domain) you want to search in. You need to provide either a domain, which would catch all FQDNs in that domain that were available in the search database, or a specific hostname. The keyword filetype indicates the file extension for the results. This keyword requires that a file extension be provided. There is no files or domain keyword that can be used in Google or other search engines."
93,A,A,1,,,,"If you found a colleague searching at pgp.mit.edu, what would they likely be looking for? 
A. Email addresses 
B.Company keys 
C.Executive names 
D.Privacy policies","The correct answer is A.
 PGP uses public servers and shared verification to store and validate keys and key ownership. Keys are owned by individuals, as a general rule. If someone were searching at pgp.mit.edu, they would likely be looking for people and, most specifically, email addresses."
94,D,D,1,,,,"What information could you get from running p0f? 
A. Local time 
B.Remote time 
C.Absolute time 
D.Uptime","The correct answer is D.
 p0f can provide the uptime for some systems. Packets don’t include any time information, so it’s not possible to gather local or remote time. Absolute time would be based in a particular time zone, and time zones aren’t communicated at the Network or Data Link layers."
95,C,C,1,,,,"The DNS server where records for a domain belonging to an organization or enterprise reside is called the _______ server. 
A. Caching 
B.Recursive 
C.Authoritative 
D.Local","The correct answer is C.
 A local caching server is what most people use to perform DNS lookups from their systems in order to get better performance. Recursion is the process used to look up DNS addresses from a caching server. Eventually, the caching server would ask an authoritative server for the information."
96,A,A,1,,,,"What strategy does a local, caching DNS server use to look up records when asked? 
A. Recursive 
B.Serial 
C.Combinatorics 
D.Bistromathics","The correct answer is A.
 DNS requests from a local caching server start with the cache, then move to root servers and then subsequent servers, always getting closer to the final destination. This process of asking a question, getting an answer, and asking again using the new information is called recursion. Neither serial nor combinatorics make sense in this context, and bistromathics is a field of study invented by Douglas Adams for the book Life, the Universe and Everything."
97,B,B,1,,,,"What would you use a job listing for when performing reconnaissance? 
A. Executive staff 
B.Technologies used 
C.Phishing targets 
D.Financial records","The correct answer is B.
 It would be unusual to find executive staff identified in a job listing. It may be possible to get phishing targets, but it’s not guaranteed, and a single individual usually isn’t identified. No financial records would be available in a job listing. Technologies used at a company, though, would be identified in order to ensure that the applicant has the right experience."
98,D,D,1,,,,"What tool could be used to gather email addresses from PGP servers: Bing, Google, or LinkedIn? 
A. whois 
B.dig 
C.netstat 
D.theHarvester","The correct answer is D.
 whois is used to inquire about domains, IP addresses, and other related information. dig is used to issue queries to DNS servers. netstat is used for network statistics. theHarvester, though, can be used to search across multiple sources, including Bing, Google, PGP servers, and LinkedIn."
99,B,B,1,,,,"What social networking site would be most likely to be useful in gathering information about a company, including job titles? 
A. Twitter 
B.LinkedIn 
C.Foursquare 
D.Facebook","The correct answer is B.
 While the others may include details about companies, only LinkedIn is primarily used as a business social networking site. People who have profiles there would list job titles, and job searches would indicate openings, including job titles."
100,A,A,1,,,,"You see the following text written down—port:502. What does that likely reference? 
A. Shodan search 
B.IO search 
C.p0f results 
D.RIR query","The correct answer is A.
 Shodan is a website you would use to look for IoT devices. The query language is similar to that used by Google, except it has additional keywords that could be used to identify network traffic. This may include port numbers. p0f is used for passive network traffic analysis. You might query an RIR for information about an IP address block. The domain name for Shodan is shodan.io, but there is no IO search."
101,D,D,1,,,,"What would you use Wappalyzer for? 
A. Analyzing web headers 
B.Analyzing application code 
C.Identifying web headers 
D.Identifying web technologies","The correct answer is D.
 WappAlyzer is an extension for the Chrome browser that can be used to identify technologies used in a website. It will, in part, use HTTP headers, but it doesn’t identify the headers. It’s also not used for analyzing web headers because there is more to what WappAlyzer does than that. It may look at some pieces of application code to get frameworks that are used, but it doesn’t analyze application code in the traditional sense of application code analysis."
102,C,C,1,,,,"What technique would you ideally use to get all of the hostnames associated with a domain? 
A. DNS query 
B.Zone copy 
C.Zone transfer 
D.Recursive request","The correct answer is C.
 A DNS query can be used to identify an IP address from a hostname or vice versa. You could potentially use a brute force technique to identify hostnames, though you may not get everything using that method. A recursive request is common from a caching server to get an authoritative response. The term for getting all the contents of the zone is a zone transfer."
103,B,B,1,,,,"What information would you not expect to find in the response to a whois query about an IP address? 
A. IP address block 
B.Domain association 
C.Address block owner 
D.Technical contact","The correct answer is B.
 When you run a whois query against an IP address, you will get the block the address belongs to, the owner of the block, and the technical contact. You will also get address information and possibly additional information. You will not get an association between a domain and the address block. This may be something you might infer, but it is not something that the results provide for you."
104,C,C,1,,,,"What would you be looking for with the following Google query? filetype:txt Administrator:500: 
A. Text files owned by Administrator 
B.Administrator login from file 
C.Text files including the text Administrator:500: 
D.500 administrator files with text","The correct answer is C.
 Google uses the keyword filetype: to identify filename extensions that should be searched. Administrator: is not a keyword, which means Administrator:500: is the search term that Google would use along with the filetype of txt, which would mean text files."
105,D,D,1,,,,"What command would you use to get the list of mail servers for a domain? 
A. whois mx zone=domain.com 
B.netstat zone=domain.com mx 
C.dig domain.com @mx 
D.dig mx domain.com","The correct answer is D.
 The command whois would be used to query the RIR for information about an IP address block. It could also be used to identify information about a domain. The program netstat is used for network statistics. dig can be used, but when you provide the @ parameter, it would be followed by the name server you want to query. The correct way to look for name server records is to use ns as the record type. When you are looking for mail servers, you would look for the mx record type."
106,B,B,1,,,,"What would you get from running the command dig ns domain.com? 
A. Mail exchanger records for domain.com 
B.Name server records for domain.com 
C.Caching name server for domain.com 
D.IP address for the hostname ns","The correct answer is B.
 Mail exchanger records would be identified as mx records. A name server record is identified with the tag ns. While an enterprise may have one or even several caching name servers, the caching name server wouldn’t be said to belong to the domain because it doesn’t have any domain identification associated with it."
107,A,A,1,,,,"If you wanted to locate detailed information about a person using either their name or a username you have, which website would you use? 
A. peekyou.com 
B.twitter.com 
C.intelius.com 
D.facebook.com","The correct answer is A.
 Twitter and Facebook are social networking sites. While you may be able to locate someone using a username, you may not be able to get detailed information about the user. Intelius is a person search site, and you can get detailed information there, but you can’t search by username. PeekYou is a web site that will allow you to search for people by either name or username."
108,C,C,1,,,,"If you were looking for detailed financial information on a target company, with what resource would you have the most success? 
A. LinkedIn 
B.Facebook 
C.EDGAR 
D.MORTIMER","The correct answer is C.
 LinkedIn is typically used for business networking, but there wouldn’t be much in the way of detailed financial information there. Facebook is a social networking site, commonly used by people for social interaction. EDGAR is the database that is maintained by the SEC and includes filing information from public companies. MORTIMER is a joke. Bonus points if you recognize what the joke is."
109,D,D,1,,,,"What financial filing is required for public companies and would provide you with the annual report? 
A. 10-Q 
B.11-K 
C.401(k) 
D.14-A","The correct answer is D.
 The 10-Q is a quarterly filing. The 11-K form is related to stock options for employees. The 401(k) is a retirement account. The 14-A report required by the SEC for public companies would include the annual report to shareholders."
110,C,C,1,,,,"If you were looking up information about a company in New Zealand, which RIR would you be looking in for data? 
A. AfriNIC 
B.RIPE 
C.APNIC 
D.LACNIC","The correct answer is C.
 New Zealand is located in Oceania, considered to be in the Pacific Rim. This means it falls under the Asia Pacific Network Information Center (APNIC). AfriNIC covers Africa. RIPE covers Europe, and LACNIC covers Latin America and parts of the Caribbean."
111,C,C,1,,,,"If you receive a RST packet back from a target host, what do you know about your target? 
A. The target is using UDP rather than TCP. 
B.The destination port is open on the target host. 
C.The source port in the RST message is closed. 
D.The target expects the PSH flag to be set.","The correct answer is C.
 A TCP scan sends messages to the target, expecting to get a response. With a SYN or full connect scan, the target will respond with a SYN/ACK message from an open port. With a closed port, the target will respond with a RST."
112,D,D,1,,,,"What is the difference between a SYN scan and a full connect scan? 
A. A SYN scan and a full connect scan are the same.  
B.A full connect scan sends an ACK message first. 
C.A SYN scan uses the PSH flag with the SYN flag. 
D.The SYN scan doesn’t complete the three-way handshake.","The correct answer is D.
 A SYN scan sends the first SYN message and then responds with a RST message after receiving the SYN/ACK from the target. A full connect scan completes the three-way handshake before sending the RST message. Since the full connect scan follows the correct order of the three-way handshake, it doesn’t send an ACK first. There is also no PSH flag sent with the SYN flag, since there is no data to push up the stack yet."
113,A,A,1,,,,"What is one reason a UDP scan may take longer than a TCP scan of the same host? 
A. UDP will retransmit more. 
B.UDP has more ports to scan. 
C.UDP is a slower protocol. 
D.UDP requires more messages to set up.","The correct answer is A.
 There is no defined response to a message to a UDP port. It is left entirely up to the application. Since a lack of response can mean the message never reached its recipient, the scanning system has to retransmit to closed ports. UDP is generally quicker than TCP because of a lack of overhead, it requires no messages to set up, and it has the same number of ports as TCP."
114,C,C,1,,,,"Why does an ACK scan not indicate clearly that ports are open? 
A. The scanner has to guess. 
B.ACK is not a supported flag. 
C.The target system ignores the message. 
D.ACK scans cause a lot of retransmits.","The correct answer is C.
 When a system receives an ACK message, meaning a TCP segment with the ACK flag enabled (bit position storing a 1), it assumes there is an open connection and there is data that is being acknowledged. When there is no open connection, there is nothing to respond with. The system, not having anything else to do with the ACK, discards it. The scanner won’t receive a response if the port is open. However, the scanner can’t be certain that the message hasn’t just been discarded by a firewall. As a result, it indicates that the port is either open or filtered. Either would result in no response. The scanner isn’t guessing; it is providing two alternatives but can’t be certain which it is. ACK is a supported flag in the right circumstances and ACK scans do not cause retransmits, since no response means one of two things."
115,A,A,1,,,,"What is one reason for using a scan like an ACK scan? 
A. It may get through firewalls and IDS devices. 
B.It is better supported. 
C.The code in nmap is more robust. 
D.An ACK scan is needed for scripting support.","The correct answer is A.
 Evasion is an important concept. You may spend a lot of time working on evading detection or getting blocked. Since an ACK without an open connection is aberrant, the firewall or IDS may ignore it, avoiding detection. As a result, you may be able to get ACK messages through. ACK scans are not better supported. In fact, there is really no support from the network stack for an ACK scan. The code is no more robust in nmap for an ACK scan than other scans, or at least there is no evidence of that being the case. ACK scans are not needed for scripting support."
116,D,D,1,,,,"What does nmap look at for fingerprinting an operating system? 
A. The operating system headers 
B.The application version 
C.The response from connecting to port 0 
D.The IP ID field and the initial sequence number","The correct answer is D.
 When nmap performs an operating system scan, it is looking for fingerprints of the network stack in the operating system kernel. Some of the information that nmap will look at is in the IP ID field to see what numbers are used. Similarly, it will look at the initial sequence number in TCP messages to see what numbers are used there. The application version isn’t relevant to an operating system scan, and there are no operating system headers that would be associated with network traffic. Operating system headers could be considered to be part of the source code for the operating system, but nmap wouldn’t be able to see those. Port 0 is considered an invalid port, so the response to a connection from that port is irrelevant."
117,B,B,1,,,,"What is nmap looking at when it conducts a version scan? 
A. TCP and IP headers 
B.Application banners 
C.Operating system kernel 
D.IP ID and TCP sequence number fields","The correct answer is B.
 A version scan with nmap is looking to identify versions of the services/applications running on the target. The kernel is identified with an OS scan. TCP and IP headers don’t provide application versions. The IP ID field and TCP sequence number fields don’t provide version information either."
118,C,C,1,,,,"What is an advantage of using masscan over nmap? 
A. masscan has been around longer. 
B.Nmap is hard to use. 
C.masscan can scan more addresses faster. 
D.masscan has access to scan more of the Internet.","The correct answer is C.
 The program masscan is a port scanner, like nmap. However, masscan was developed to scan the entire Internet as quickly as possible. As a result, if speed is a consideration, and especially if you are scanning large address blocks, masscan is probably better suited for that task. Both nmap and masscan have access to the same address space, and masscan uses the same command-line parameters, for the most part, as nmap, so they are similarly easy to use. nmap has also been around for considerably longer, since the 1990s, than masscan has."
119,B,B,1,,,,"If you were to see the following command run, what would you assume? hping -S -p 25 10.5.16.2 
A. Someone was trying to probe the web port of the target. 
B.Someone was trying to probe an email port on the target. 
C.Someone was trying to identify if SNMP was supported on 10.5.16.2. 
D.Someone had mistyped ping.","The correct answer is B.
 hping is a program used to send specially designed messages to a target. You use command-line parameters to tell hping what to include in the message being sent. The command hping -S -p 25 10.5.16.2 is used to have hping send SYN messages to port 25, the default SMTP port, at 10.5.16.2. It’s possible that someone mistyped ping, but those parameters aren’t used by ping programs, and since they are coherent for the action above, it makes more sense that they were trying to use hping. SNMP and web traffic both use different ports than port 25."
120,D,D,1,,,,"If you were to see that someone was using OpenVAS, followed by Nessus, what might you assume? 
A. They were trying to break into a system. 
B.They didn’t know how to use Nessus. 
C.They didn’t know how to use OpenVAS. 
D.They were trying to reduce false positives.","The correct answer is D.
 Vulnerability scanners don’t exploit vulnerabilities in order to gain access to a system. They would only exploit a vulnerability to the extent necessary to determine whether a vulnerability exists. If they didn’t know how to use Nessus or OpenVAS, they likely wouldn’t be using them. It’s possible they are looking to compare results from the two, but it’s also very likely they are trying to compare the results with the intention of reducing false positives."
121,A,A,1,,,,"What is the difference between a false positive and a false negative? 
A. A false positive indicates a finding that doesn’t exist, while a false negative doesn’t indicate a finding that does exist. 
B.A false positive indicates a finding that does exist, while a false negative doesn’t indi- cate a finding that doesn’t exist. 
C.A false positive doesn’t indicate a finding that does exist, while a false negative does indicate a finding that doesn’t exist. 
D.A false negative does indicate a finding that doesn’t exist, while a false positive doesn’t indicate a finding that does exist.","The correct answer is A.
 A false positive is when a finding is identified when it doesn’t actually exist. A false negative is when there is no finding identified but, in fact, there is a vulnerability. A true positive is when a finding is identified that is a vulnerability. A true negative is when a finding isn’t identified and there is no known vulnerability."
122,D,D,1,,,,"What would be the purpose of running a ping sweep? 
A. You want to identify responsive hosts without a port scan. 
B.You want to use something that is light on network traffic. 
C.You want to use a protocol that may be allowed through the firewall. 
D.All of the above.","The correct answer is D.
 There may be several reasons for performing a ping sweep. You likely want to identify responsive hosts on the network segment you are targeting. You may not, though, want to use a full port scan. ICMP is a lightweight protocol and there is a chance it will be allowed through the firewall, since it’s used for troubleshooting and diagnostics."
123,C,C,1,,,,"Which of these may be considered worst practice when it comes to vulnerability scans? 
A. Scanning production servers 
B.Notifying operations staff ahead of time 
C.Taking no action on the results 
D.Using limited details in your scan reports","The correct answer is C.
 You would be expected to scan production servers, since that would be where you would be most interested to find vulnerabilities. Letting operations staff know ahead of time is polite since vulnerability scans may inadvertently knock over systems that would need to be stood back up. Being paged in the middle of the night unexpectedly isn’t fun. If you know it’s coming, it makes it easier. You may have reasons to use limited details in your scan reports, including trying to reduce the disk space used or the paper used in printing the reports. Taking no action on the results of a vulnerability scan is about the worst thing you can do when it comes to vulnerability scans. It’s worse than not running them, since you could be considered liable because you know about the vulnerabilities but you aren’t doing anything about them."
124,B,B,1,,,,"Which of these may be considered an evasive technique? 
A. Scanning nonstandard ports 
B.Encoding data 
C.Using a proxy server 
D.Using nmap in blind mode","The correct answer is B.
 Scanning nonstandard ports isn’t evasive. It’s just as noisy as, and potentially more detectable than, scanning standard ports. You could use a proxy for some tasks, but all it would do would be to hide your own IP address, which isn’t evasive. You could still be blocked or detected. Nmap does not have a blind mode. When you encode data, though, you make it harder for the firewall or IDS to identify something bad that may be happening, since these devices can’t read the messages coming through."
125,A,A,1,,,,"If you were to notice operating system commands inside a DNS request while looking at a packet capture, what might you be looking at? 
A. Tunneling attack 
B.DNS amplification 
C.DNS recursion 
D.XML entity injection","The correct answer is A.
 Tunneling attacks can be used to hide one protocol inside another. They may be used to send operating system commands using a tunnel system. A DNS amplification attack is where a small DNS request results in much larger responses sent to the target. DNS recursion is used to look up information from DNS servers. An XML entity injection attack is a web-based attack and wouldn’t be found inside a DNS request."
126,C,C,1,,,,"What is an XMAS scan? 
A. TCP scan with SYN/ACK/FIN set 
B.UDP scan with FIN/PSH set 
C.TCP scan with FIN/PSH/URG set 
D.UDP scan SYN/URG/FIN set","The correct answer is C.
 The XMAS scan is a TCP scan that uses unusual flag settings in the TCP headers to attempt to evade firewalls or IDSs. The XMAS scan uses the FIN, PSH, and URG flags and is called an XMAS scan because it looks like the packet is lit up like a Christmas tree. None of the other answers match what an XMAS scan is."
127,B,B,1,,,,"What would you use MegaPing for? 
A. Running exploits 
B.Running a port scan 
C.Issuing manual web requests 
D.Crafting packets","The correct answer is B.
 MegaPing can be used to perform a lot of different functions, but crafting packets, sending manual web requests, and running exploits are not functions it supports. It can, though, run a port scan."
128,D,D,1,,,,"What would be a reason to use the Override feature in OpenVAS? 
A. You want to run a different plug-in for a vulnerability. 
B.You want to change the scanner settings. 
C.You want to use TCP rather than UDP. 
D.You want to change a severity rating on a finding.","The correct answer is D.
 Plug-ins are matched to vulnerabilities. A different plug-in would identify a different vulnerability and there is no way to change that. Scanner settings can be changed when you set up a scan. Using TCP rather than UDP is vague. If you want to change a severity rating from the one supplied by OpenVAS, you would override that rating. You may have mitigations in place or you may have investigated and found the finding to be a false positive."
129,C,C,1,,,,"What would you use credentials for in a vulnerability scanner? 
A. Better reliability in network findings 
B.Authenticating through VPNs for scans 
C.Scanning for local vulnerabilities 
D.Running an Active Directory scan","The correct answer is C.
 Credentials wouldn’t give better reliability in network findings, and vulnerability scanners don’t typically provide a way to directly authenticate through a VPN. The VPN client would be expected to be running ahead of time if the network is behind the VPN. An Active Directory scan is a vague answer, and it may not be something you can do with a vulnerability scanner. If you provide credentials, though, the scanner can authenticate against systems on the network and check for local vulnerabilities."
130,C,C,1,,,,"What is fragroute primarily used for? 
A. Altering network routes 
B.Capturing fragmented packets 
C.Fragmenting application traffic 
D.Fragmenting layer 2 and layer 3 headers","The correct answer is C.
 The program fragroute uses configuration statements to determine what should be done to packets destined for a specific host. This may include fragmenting application traffic as well as duplicating and delaying traffic. While there is a possibility of fragmenting layer 3 headers, if layer 2 headers were fragmented, there would be no way to get the message to the destination."
131,A,A,1,,,,"What is are RPCs primarily used for? 
A. Interprocess communications 
B.Interprocess semaphores 
C.Remote method invocation 
D.Process demand paging","The correct answer is A.
 Remote procedure calls are a way for processes on one system to communicate with processes on another system. This does not preclude two processes on the same system communicating, of course. Semaphores are another concept in computer science that can enable interprocess communication. Remote method invocation is a way for Java programs to implement interprocess communications. Process demand paging isn’t a thing."
132,C,C,1,,,,"What would you be trying to enumerate if you were to use enum4linux? 
A. Procedures 
B.Linux-based services 
C.Shares and/or users 
D.Memory utilization","The correct answer is C.
 enum4linux is a tool that makes use of other, underlying tools to scan systems that have implemented SMB.
 This means enum4linux can be used to enumerate shares or users, as well as other information. None of the other options are valid."
133,D,D,1,,,,"How do you authenticate with SNMPv1? 
A. Username/password 
B.Hash 
C.Public string 
D.Community string","The correct answer is D.
 SNMPv3 implemented username and password authentication. With version 1, you used a cleartext community string. SNMP doesn’t use hashes, and while the word public is often used to describe a community string, a public string is not a way to authenticate with SNMPv1."
134,C,C,1,,,,"What SMTP command would you use to get the list of users in a mailing list? 
A. EXPD 
B.VRFY 
C.EXPN 
D.VRML","The correct answer is C.
 The SMTP command used to expand a mailing list alias to get the underlying email addresses that belong to that mailing list or group is EXPN. VRFY is verify, and the other two are not valid SMTP commands."
135,B,B,1,,,,"What type of enumeration would you use the utility dirb for? 
A. Directory listings 
B.Directory enumeration 
C.Brute force dialing 
D.User directory analysis","The correct answer is B.
 The utility dirb uses a word list to attempt to enumerate directories available through a web server that may not be available by looking at all the pages and links in the site."
136,D,D,1,,,,"What are data descriptions in SNMP called? 
A. Management-based information 
B.Data structure definition 
C.Extensible markup language 
D.Management information base","The correct answer is D.
 SNMP can be used to retrieve information from remote systems. This information has to be described, including the different data types. All of the information available is described in a management information base (MIB). The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a way of packaging data in a structured way but it is not used in SNMP."
137,A,A,1,,,,"What is the process Java programs identify themselves to if they are sharing procedures over the network? 
A. RMI registry 
B.RMI mapper 
C.RMI database 
D.RMI process","The correct answer is A.
 Interprocess communications across systems using a network is called Remote Method Invocation. The process with which programs have to communicate to get a dynamic port allocation is the RMI registry. This is the program you query to identify services that are available on a system that has implemented RMI."
138,C,C,1,,,,"You are working with a colleague and you see them interacting with an email server using the VRFY command. What is it your colleague is doing? 
A. Verifying SMTP commands 
B.Verifying mailing lists 
C.Verifying email addresses 
D.Verifying the server config","The correct answer is C.
 The extended SMTP (ESMTP) protocol has a command that is abbreviated VRFY that is used to verify email addresses. A mail server may or may not have exposed this command, even if the server software supports ESMTP. Expanding mailing lists is EXPN. You wouldn’t use VRFY for a mailing list in that same sense. The other two don’t have specific commands that are specified in the SMTP protocol definition."
139,B,B,1,,,,"What is the SMB protocol used for? 
A. Data transfers using NFS 
B.Data transfers on Windows systems 
C.Data transfers for email attachments 
D.Data transfers for Windows Registry updates","The correct answer is B.
 The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is used for multiple functions on Windows networks. One of them is to transfer files (data) from one system to another. Email attachments would be transmitted using SMTP. NFS manages its own data transfer when files are being copied from one system to another. There are no data transfers specifically for Windows Registry updates."
140,D,D,1,,,,"Which of these is a built-in program on Windows for gathering information using SMB? 
A. nmblookup 
B.smbclient 
C.Metasploit 
D.nbtstat","The correct answer is D.
 The program nmblookup can be used on Linux systems. smbclient is a program that comes with a Samba installation that can be used to interact with a system using SMB.
 Metasploit has a lot of functions, but it’s not built into Windows. The program nbtstat, though, can be used to gather information using SMB, and it is a program that is installed with Windows."
141,A,A,1,,,,"What status code will you get if your attempt to use the VRFY command fails? 
A. 550 
B.501 
C.250 
D.200","The correct answer is A.
 The status code you would get if your VRFY command failed against an SMTP server is 550. 200 is the status code for success with a web server. The other codes are not valid in this context."
142,B,B,1,,,,"What program would you use to enumerate services? 
A. smbclient 
B.Nmap 
C.enum4linux 
D.snmpwalk","The correct answer is B.
 The programs smbclient and enum4linux may be used to enumerate information using SMB.
 The program snmpwalk can be used to enumerate information over SNMP. Nmap, though, can be used to enumerate services running on all the systems on a network."
143,D,D,1,,,,"What version of SNMP introduced encryption and user-based authentication? 
A. 1 
B.2 
C.2c 
D.3","The correct answer is D.
 Version 1 of SNMP used community strings. Version 2c also used community strings. Version 2 improved version 1, but it was version 3 that implemented user-based authentication as well as encryption."
144,A,A,1,,,,"Which of these could you enumerate on a WordPress site using wpscan? 
A. Plug-ins 
B.Posts 
C.Administrators 
D.Versions","The correct answer is A.
 The program wpscan can be used to enumerate themes, users, and plug-ins. It can’t be used to enumerate administrators, specifically. It also can’t be used to enumerate posts, and since there would only be a single version, you wouldn’t enumerate versions."
145,B,B,1,,,,"Which of these tools allows you to create your own enumeration function based on ports being identified as open? 
A. Metasploit 
B.Nmap 
C.Netcat 
D.nbtstat","The correct answer is B.
 Metasploit can be extended with user-created programs. However, you wouldn’t call a Metasploit module based on ports being open. Netcat doesn’t do any enumeration, and nbtstat is a Windows program that can’t be extended. Nmap can be extended with user- written scripts. An nmap script includes a port registration so nmap knows to call that script when specific ports are found to be open."
146,C,C,1,,,,"What underlying functionality is necessary to enable Windows file sharing? 
A. Network File System 
B.Common Internet File System 
C.Remote procedure call 
D.Remote Method Invocation","The correct answer is C.
 SMB relies on remote procedure calls (RPCs) in order to function. The common Internet File System (CIFS) is an implementation of file sharing and system management using SMB.
 The Network File System (NFS) is a protocol that makes use of remote procedure calls. Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is a way to call procedures remotely over Java."
147,D,D,1,,,,"What is the IPC$ share used for? 
A. Process piping 
B.Interprocess construction 
C.Remote process management 
D.Interprocess communication","The correct answer is D.
 The IPC$ share is a named pipe that enables interprocess communications over a network. While you may be able to do some remote management using the IPC$ share, it is not used for remote process management."
148,B,B,1,,,,"What tool does a Java program need to use to implement remote process communication? 
A. JRE 
B.rmic 
C.rmir 
D.JDK","The correct answer is B.
 The JRE is the Java runtime environment and is necessary to run Java programs. The JDK is the Java development kit and is necessary to develop Java programs. The program rmic is used to create RMI programs. It creates the stubs necessary for RMI to function. rmir isn’t anything."
149,C,C,1,,,,"Which of these passes objects between systems? 
A. SunRPC 
B.SMB 
C.RMI 
D.Nmap","The correct answer is C.
 RMI is a way to implement interprocess communications using Java. Since Java is an object-oriented programming language, it would transmit objects. SMB is the Server Message Block protocol. SunRPC does remote procedure calls but the data transmitted isn’t object oriented. Nmap is a program used to scan ports."
150,A,A,1,,,,"If you needed to enumerate data across multiple services and also store the data for retrieval later, what tool would you use? 
A. Metasploit 
B.Nmap 
C.RMI 
D.Postgres","The correct answer is A.
 While nmap is an excellent program in its own right and can be used to enumerate data across multiple services, it doesn’t store data for retrieval later without some additional help. Metasploit can also be used to enumerate data across multiple services and also uses a database on the backend to store data to be retrieved later. RMI is Remote Method Invocation, a way to implement interprocess communications across a network. Postgresql is the database server commonly used underneath Metasploit. Postgres is a much older version of what is now PostgreSQL."
151,D,D,1,,,,"What are the three times that are typically stored as part of file metadata? 
A. Moves, adds, changes  
B.Modified, accessed, deleted 
C.Moved, accessed, changed 
D.Modified, accessed, created","The correct answer is D.
 There are three date and time stamps commonly used in file metadata. When the file is created, that moment is stored. When a file is accessed by a user, that moment is stored. When a file is modified, that moment is stored. Accessed is not the same as modified since accessing a file could be read-only. You could open a file expecting to modify it, but not end up doing the modification. The access time still changes. While moves, adds, and changes may sometimes be referred to as MAC, like modified, accessed, and created, those are not tasks associated with file times."
152,A,A,1,,,,"What is it called when you obtain administrative privileges from a normal user account? 
A. Privilege escalation 
B.Account migration 
C.Privilege migration 
D.Account escalation","The correct answer is A.
 Account migration, privilege migration, and account escalation are vague and don’t have clearly defined definitions, even if they may exist. Privilege escalation, on the other hand, is used to gain elevated privileges when you only have the permissions of a normal user."
153,B,B,1,,,,"What does John the Ripper’s single crack mode, the default mode, do? 
A. Checks every possible password 
B.Uses known information and mangling rules 
C.Uses a built-in wordlist 
D.Uses wordlist and mangling rules","The correct answer is B.
 Incremental mode in John will run an attack in which it will try every possible password within specified parameters, meaning John will generate the passwords. The default mode in John is single crack mode, which uses information including the username and the home directory to generate a password using mangling rules. Incremental mode does not use wordlists, though John does support the use of wordlists."
154,D,D,1,,,,"What is the trade-off for using rainbow tables? 
A. Disk space prioritized over speed 
B.Accuracy prioritized over disk space 
C.Speed prioritized over accuracy 
D.Speed prioritized over disk space","The correct answer is D.
 Rainbow tables use precomputed hashes that are mapped to plaintext passwords in order to speed up the process of obtaining the passwords from stored hashes. Rainbow tables, though, are very expensive when it comes to disk space. Hashes and passwords are stored in the rainbow tables. Accuracy is neither sacrificed nor prioritized using rainbow tables. You will give up disk space to get faster cracking times using rainbow tables."
155,C,C,1,,,,"Which of these is a reason to use an exploit against a local vulnerability? 
A. Pivoting 
B.Log manipulation 
C.Privilege escalation 
D.Password collection","The correct answer is C.
 Local vulnerabilities are used against applications that are not listening on the network. This means they require you to be “local” to the machine and not remote. In other words, you have to be logged in somehow. A local vulnerability would not be used to collect passwords; you don’t need a vulnerability to do that. Similarly, you don’t need to make use of a vulnerability to manipulate logs or to pivot. Most of those would require you to have elevated permissions, though. A local vulnerability may be exploited to get you those elevated permissions."
156,B,B,1,,,,"What is it called when you manipulate the time stamps on files? 
A. Time stamping 
B.Timestomping 
C.Meta stomping 
D.Meta manipulation","The correct answer is B.
 Manipulating time stamps on files is called timestomping. It is used to set file times, which may be used to throw off investigations or identify intrusions. None of the other answers are real things."
157,A,A,1,,,,"What would an attacker use an alternate data stream on a Windows system for? 
A. Hiding files 
B.Running programs 
C.Storing PowerShell scripts 
D.Blocking files","The correct answer is A.
 Alternate data streams are a function of the New Technology File System (NTFS), created to support the resource forks of Apple’s file system in Windows NT. Since many of the utilities and programs in Windows don’t natively understand alternate data streams, they can’t make use of them and won’t show them. The file can be accessed if the user knows how to display and manipulate the alternate data streams."
158,A,A,1,,,,"Which of these techniques might be used to maintain access to a system? 
A. Run key in the Windows Registry 
B.Alternate data stream 
C..vimrc file on Linux 
D.PowerShell","The correct answer is A.
 You may use a PowerShell script to perform functions that could support persistence on a system, but the PowerShell script alone won’t be used to maintain access. Alternate data streams won’t be of any use for maintaining access, and a .vimrc file is a startup file for the Vi editor. The run key in the Windows Registry, though, could be used to put an entry in that would run a program automatically that could make sure an attacker could get access even after a reboot."
159,D,D,1,,,,"If you were looking for reliable exploits you could use against known vulnerabilities, what would you use? 
A. Tor network 
B.Meterpreter 
C.msfvenom 
D.Exploit-DB","The correct answer is D.
 While the Tor network may be used to obtain an exploit against a vulnerability, there is some question as to how reliable that exploit may be. The Tor network may contain malicious content, even in the case of source code. Meterpreter and msfvenom are elements of Metasploit that don’t have anything to do with locating vulnerabilities. Exploit-DB is a website and repository of exploits that could be searched to locate an exploit targeting specific and known vulnerabilities."
160,C,C,1,,,,"What might an attacker be trying to do by using the clearev command in Meterpreter? 
A. Run an exploit 
B.Manipulate time stamps 
C.Manipulate log files 
D.Remote login","The correct answer is C.
 The clearev command is a Meterpreter command used to clear the Windows Event Viewer logs. While you may be able to manipulate time stamps and log files in Meterpreter, you wouldn’t use the clearev command for that. The clearev command does not allow an attacker to log in remotely."
161,B,B,1,,,,"You find after you get access to a system that you are the user www-data. What might you try to do very shortly after getting access to the system? 
A. Pivot to another network 
B.Elevate privileges 
C.Wipe logs 
D.Exploit the web browser","The correct answer is B.
 When the Apache web server runs on a Linux system, it will commonly run as the user www-data. This is a privilege-restricted account that would prevent an attacker from doing much on the system. In order to do anything, like wiping log files or pivoting to another network, you would need to elevate privileges to administrative/root level. Exploiting the web browser wouldn’t be done in this context. A web server more than likely wouldn’t even have a web browser installed."
162,C,C,1,,,,"You’ve installed multiple files and processes on the compromised system. What should you also look at installing? 
A. Registry keys 
B.Alternate data streams 
C.Rootkit 
D.Root login","The correct answer is C.
 Attackers often install extra files and run extra processes on systems. These could easily be detected by manual investigation or, certainly, by automated detection tools. The way around that is to install a rootkit, which may include kernel-mode drivers or replacement system utilities that would hide the existence of these files and processes. Alternate data streams may be used to hide files but not processes. Registry keys could also hide files but not processes."
163,B,B,1,,,,"What does pivoting on a compromised system get you? 
A. Database access 
B.A route to extra networks 
C.Higher level of privileges 
D.Persistent access","The correct answer is B.
 Pivoting is the process of using a compromised system to move onto other systems and networks within the target environment. Pivoting does not get you higher-level permissions or persistent access. You may ultimately get to a database server by pivoting, but that’s not what pivoting does or is specifically used for. It would be a nice side effect of pivoting."
164,B,B,1,,,,"What would you use the program rtgen for? 
A. Generating wordlists 
B.Generating rainbow tables 
C.Generating firewall rules 
D.Persistent access","The correct answer is B.
 The program rtgen is a program that is part of the rcrack suite. rcrack is used to crack passwords with rainbow tables. It is used to generate the rainbow tables that rcrack will use to crack passwords. Rainbow tables are not wordlists but mappings of plaintext passwords to hashes, which makes it much easier to get passwords from hashes."
165,C,C,1,,,,"Which of these would be a way to exploit a client-side vulnerability? 
A. Sending malformed packets to a web server 
B.Sending large ICMP packets 
C.Sending a crafted URL 
D.Brute-force password attack","The correct answer is C.
 Malformed packets could potentially cause a failure or trigger a vulnerability on the server side. Large ICMP packets aren’t likely to do anything and certainly wouldn’t exploit a client-side vulnerability. A brute-force password attack isn’t exploiting a vulnerability, even if it is an attack technique. Sending a crafted URL could potentially exploit a client- side vulnerability in a web browser."
166,A,A,1,,,,"What is one outcome from process injection? 
A. Hidden process 
B.Rootkit 
C.Alternate data streams 
D.Steganography","The correct answer is A.
 Steganography is the process of hiding data inside of other data, such as media files like MP3s, WAVs, or video files. An alternate data stream is a secondary data stream attached to a filename in the NT file system. A rootkit can be used to hide processes. It may use process injection but wouldn’t be the outcome from process injection. When you inject into a process, you are putting executable operations you have created into the space of another executable. The end result could be an execution thread running your code without any new process name indicating it was running."
167,D,D,1,,,,"What tool would you use to compromise a system and then perform post-exploitation actions? 
A. Nmap 
B.John the Ripper 
C.searchsploit 
D.Metasploit","The correct answer is D.
 John the Ripper is used for cracking passwords, while nmap is used for port scanning. They could be part of the overall process of system compromise, but neither could be used to compromise a system, in spite of what it suggests in The Matrix. searchsploit is a program used to search a local exploit-db repository. Metasploit is an exploit framework that could be used to compromise a system. Once the system is compromised, Metasploit could then be used for post-exploitation actions using modules that come with it."
168,B,B,1,,,,"What application would be a common target for client-side exploits? 
A. Web server 
B.Web browser 
C.Web application firewall 
D.Web pages","The correct answer is B.
 Of all of the options presented, only the web browser exists on the client side. By definition, the web server is on the server. A web application firewall is placed with the server to protect the server from Application layer attacks. Web pages are hosted on a web server. They are not a target for client-side exploits, though they would be used to carry out those attacks."
169,C,C,1,,,,"What are two advantages of using a rootkit? 
A. Installing alternate data streams and Registry keys 
B.Creating Registry keys and hidden processes 
C.Hiding processes and files 
D.Hiding files and Registry keys","The correct answer is C.
 A rootkit is a piece of malicious software that is used to accomplish several tasks. This may include hiding processes and files through the use of kernel-mode drivers or replaced system utilities. A rootkit may also provide a backdoor for attackers to maintain long-term access to the system after the initial compromise. None of the other answers are things that a rootkit does."
170,B,B,1,,,,"What could you use to obtain password hashes from a compromised system? 
A. John the Ripper 
B.Mimikatz 
C.Rainbow tables 
D.Process dumping","The correct answer is B.
 John the Ripper and Rainbow tables are tools for cracking passwords, not gathering or obtaining password hashes. Process dumping could possibly yield passwords associated with a certain process/application. However, you may not get password hashes, depending on how the passwords are maintained in memory. Process dumping is taking the memory space of a process and writing it out to disk for analysis. Mimikatz is a utility and Metasploit module that could be used to extract passwords from a compromised system."
171,A,A,1,,,,"In a botnet, what are the systems that tell individual bots what to do called? 
A. C2 servers 
B.IRC servers 
C.HTTP servers 
D.ISC2 servers","The correct answer is A.
 C2 servers are command and control servers. These are servers that can be used to provide management and control of bots in a botnet. The communication may be IRC or HTTP, but not necessarily. The servers aren’t called that in a botnet anyway. ISC2 servers don’t exist."
172,C,C,1,,,,"What is the primary difference between a worm and a virus? 
A. A worm uses polymorphic code. 
B.A virus uses polymorphic code. 
C.A worm can self-propagate. 
D.A virus can self-propagate.","The correct answer is C.
 Both worms and viruses could be written to use polymorphic code, which means they could modify what they look like as they propagate. A worm, though, could self-propagate. It’s the one distinction between worms and viruses. Viruses require some intervention on the part of the user to propagate and execute."
173,C,C,1,,,,"What is one advantage of static analysis over dynamic analysis of malware? 
A. Malware is guaranteed to deploy. 
B.Dynamic analysis is untrustworthy. 
C.Static analysis limits your exposure to infection. 
D.Static analysis can be run in virtual machines.","The correct answer is C.
 Static analysis is looking at the properties of the executable file and evaluating the assembly language code without running the program. This will limit your exposure to infection, because if you do it right you aren’t running the program, which would infect you. Dynamic analysis is trustworthy, and malware can’t deploy if you don’t run it. Dynamic analysis is commonly done in virtual machines."
174,D,D,1,,,,"What would you use VirusTotal for? 
A. Checking your system for viruses 
B.Endpoint protection 
C.As a repository of malware research 
D.Identifying malware against antivirus engines","The correct answer is D.
 VirusTotal takes dozens of antivirus engines and runs samples through them to identify what malware they might be. VirusTotal is a website, which means it can’t check your system for viruses and also can’t do any endpoint protection. While VirusTotal can identify the name given to a malware sample by different antivirus solutions, to find the research associated with that malware, you would need to check with the antivirus vendor."
175,D,D,1,,,,"What are two sections you would commonly find in a portable executable file? 
A. Text and binary 
B.Binary and data 
C.Addresses and operations 
D.Text and data","The correct answer is D.
 PE files have multiple sections that you may find in an executable. Two that are very common, though, are .text and .data. The .text section includes all the executable code. The .data section includes all the predefined and initialized variables. The other sections listed in other answers aren’t sections of a PE file."
176,B,B,1,,,,"What could you use to generate your own malware? 
A. Empire 
B.Metasploit 
C.Rcconsole 
D.IDA Pro","The correct answer is B.
 Metasploit can be used to generate your own malware from one of the payload modules. Empire is another exploitation framework built around PowerShell. IDA Pro is a debugger and Rcconsole doesn’t exist."
177,A,A,1,,,,"What is the purpose of a packer for malware? 
A. To obscure the actual program 
B.To ensure that the program is all binary 
C.To compile the program into a tight space 
D.To remove null characters","The correct answer is A.
 All programs that have been compiled are in binary. Even scripting languages are in binary by the time they hit the processor. Packers will make a program smaller, which was initially of some value when bandwidth wasn’t as ubiquitous, but a packer doesn’t do any compilation. A packer does not remove null characters. A packer can, however, obscure the actual program code because the only executable function is one designed to extract and decompress the real malware."
178,C,C,1,,,,"What is the primary purpose of polymorphic code for malware programs? 
A. Efficiency of execution 
B.Propagation of the malware 
C.Antivirus evasion 
D.Faster compilation","The correct answer is C.
 Polymorphic means many bodies, which means it has multiple looks. When a program has multiple looks, it can cause antivirus programs to misidentify it. Polymorphic code rewrites the program when it is copied or moved from one system or location to another. It isn’t more efficient and doesn’t help with propagation, though it could be part of the propagation process. It also doesn’t speed compilation."
179,B,B,1,,,,"What would be one reason not to write malware in Python? 
A. Python interpreter is slow. 
B.Python interpreter may not be available. 
C.Library support is inadequate. 
D.Python is a hard language to learn.","The correct answer is B.
 Python interpreters may be considered slower to execute than a compiled program, but the difference is negligible and speed of execution generally isn’t much of a concern when it comes to malware. Python is not a hard language to learn, and there are a lot of community-developed libraries. One challenge, though, is that you may need a Python interpreter unless you go through the step of getting a Python compiler and compiling your script. Windows systems wouldn’t commonly have a Python interpreter installed."
180,C,C,1,,,,"What would you use Cuckoo Sandbox for? 
A. Static analysis of malware 
B.Malware development 
C.Dynamic analysis of malware 
D.Manual analysis of malware","The correct answer is C.
 Cuckoo Sandbox is a set of programs and infrastructure used to run malware and identify changes to the system that result. This means it is used for dynamic analysis of malware, not for static analysis. Because it’s automated, it’s not manual. Also, it’s used for analysis, not development."
181,B,B,1,,,,"If you wanted a tool that could help with both static and dynamic analysis of malware, which would you choose? 
A. Cutter 
B.IDA 
C.PE Explorer 
D.MalAlyzer","The correct answer is B.
 You need a tool that can perform disassembly if you are doing static analysis. Dynamic analysis can make use of disassembled executables, but the tool would need to also be able to execute the code. IDA is the only tool there that does both disassembly and execution. Cutter only does disassembly. PE Explorer does neither, and MalAlyzer doesn’t exist."
182,A,A,1,,,,"What is the purpose of using a disassembler? 
A. Converting opcodes to mnemonics 
B.Converting mnemonics to opcodes 
C.Translating mnemonics to operations 
D.Removing the need for an assembler","The correct answer is A.
 An executable contains a set of binary values that the CPU will interpret as operation codes (opcodes) when the program is run. These binary values won’t generally mean much to people when they are bare. As a result, disassemblers are used to convert opcodes to mnemonics, which are short/abbreviated words that can let someone know what the opcode does."
183,C,C,1,,,,"What does the malware that is referred to as a dropper do? 
A. Drops antivirus operations 
B.Drops CPU protections against malicious execution 
C.Drops files that may be more malware 
D.Drops the malware into the Recycle Bin","The correct answer is C.
 A dropper downloads (drops) additional files, which may be malware. It doesn’t do any of the things mentioned in the other options."
184,B,B,1,,,,"Why would you use an encoder when you are creating malware using Metasploit? 
A. To compile the malware 
B.To evade antivirus 
C.To evade user detection 
D.To compress the malware","The correct answer is B.
 An encoder is used to alter the look of an executable file. This alteration is done in order to prevent the antivirus program from recognizing the executable as malware. It doesn’t compile the malware and doesn’t evade user detection. A packer would be used to compress malware."
185,B,B,1,,,,"If you were to see the following command in someone’s history, what would you think had happened? msfvenom -i 5 -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp -o program 
A. A poison pill was created. 
B.A malicious program was generated. 
C.Existing malware was encoded. 
D.Metasploit was started.","The correct answer is B.
 The program msfvenom is used to convert a payload module from Metasploit into an executable program. The malware could potentially be used as part of a poison pill, which is a type of defensive tactic, but it’s hard to determine that just from the command line. While the malware is encoded as part of this process, it is not an existing piece of malware. This is not a way to start Metasploit, though msfvenom does make use of the Metasploit framework."
186,A,A,1,,,,"What is the difference between a virus and ransomware? 
A. Ransomware may be a virus. 
B.Ransomware includes Bitcoins. 
C.Ransomware is only generated in Russia. 
D.A virus only runs on Windows systems.","The correct answer is A.
 This is a bit of a trick question. Ransomware may be a virus, which means it is a subset of the category virus. Ransomware may ask to be paid in Bitcoins, but it doesn’t include Bitcoins. Ransomware has been generated all over the world and viruses run on all operating systems."
187,C,C,1,,,,"Why would someone use a Trojan? 
A. It acts as malware infrastructure. 
B.It evades antivirus. 
C.It pretends to be something else. 
D.It’s polymorphic.","The correct answer is C.
 A Trojan, also called a Trojan horse, appears to be one thing but is, in fact, another. It can fool users into running the malware because they are expecting something else. A Trojan can’t evade antivirus if there is a signature that matches the executable. It doesn’t act as malware infrastructure, and while it may be polymorphic, that wouldn’t be why someone used a Trojan."
188,B,B,1,,,,"Which of these tools would be most beneficial when trying to dynamically analyze malware? 
A. Cutter 
B.OllyDbg 
C.Metasploit 
D.AV-Test","The correct answer is B.
 When you are trying to dynamically analyze malware, a debugger is useful because it allows you to run the malware and also control its execution. OllyDbg is the only debugger in that list. Cutter does disassembly but does not allow you to run the malware and control its execution."
189,Client,Client,1,,,,Which end of a client/server communication goes on the infected system if it is communi- cating with infrastructure?,"The correct answer is Client. The malware would act as a client. The client is the end of the conversation that initiates the communication. It’s better to initiate from inside the network to get through firewalls, which may block inbound communication flows."
190,D,D,1,,,,"Which of these would be a reason why it is best for communications to originate from inside the infected network? 
A. Antivirus 
B.Virtual machines 
C.Intrusion detection 
D.Firewall","The correct answer is D.
 The firewall may block inbound communications, which is why it’s better for the communication to originate from the inside. Either direction could be caught by intrusion detection. Virtual machines don’t factor in here, and antivirus could catch the malware regardless of which direction the traffic is going, since antivirus uses the executable file rather than the communication stream for detection."
191,C,C,1,,,,"Which hardware vendor uses the term SPAN on switches? 
A. HP 
B.3COM 
C.Cisco 
D.Juniper","The correct answer is C.
 Different vendors use different terms to refer to port mirroring. Cisco uses the term Switch Port Analyzer (SPAN), which leads to the process sometimes being called port spanning."
192,B,B,1,,,,"If you saw the following command line, what would you be capturing? tcpdump -i eth2 host 192.168.10.5 
A. Traffic just from 192.168.10.5 
B.Traffic to and from 192.168.10.5 
C.Traffic just to 192.168.10.5 
D.All traffic other than from 192.168.86.5","The correct answer is B.
 The expression host 192.168.10.5 is BPF, indicating that tcpdump should only capture packets to and from 192.168.10.5. If you wanted to only get it to or from, you would need to modify host with src or dest."
193,D,D,1,,,,"In the following packet, what port is the source port? 20:45:55.272087 IP yazpistachio.lan.62882 > loft.lan.afs3-fileserver: Flags [P.], seq 915235445:915235528, ack 3437317287, win 2048, options [nop,nop,TS val 1310611430 ecr 1794010423], length 83 
A. lan 
B.fileserver 
C.yazpistachio 
D.62882","The correct answer is D.
 tcpdump uses the format hostname/IP.port when it prints an address. The addresses go source > destination, so yazpistachio.lan is the hostname and 62882 is the port on the source address."
194,A,A,1,,,,"What is one downside to running a default tcpdump without any parameters? 
A. DNS requests 
B.Not enough information 
C.Sequence numbers don’t show 
D.tcpdump won’t run without additional parameters","The correct answer is A.
 By default, tcpdump does name resolution. Not only does tcpdump look up port numbers and print their service names, it also triggers a DNS lookup. This DNS lookup is network traffic, which means that for most packets there is probably a DNS lookup request showing in the packet capture."
195,C,C,1,,,,"At which protocol layer does the Berkeley Packet Filter operate? 
A. Internetwork 
B.Transport 
C.Data Link 
D.Protocol","The correct answer is C.
 BPF operates at the Data Link layer. This allows filtering down to the MAC address. If BPF operated at other layers, you wouldn’t get the entire set of packet headers."
196,C,C,1,,,,"What do we call an ARP response without a corresponding ARP request? 
A. Is-at response 
B. Who-has ARP 
C.Gratuitous ARP 
D.IP response","The correct answer is C.
 When an ARP response is sent without a corresponding ARP request, it’s an unexpected or unnecessary message. This makes it a gratuitous ARP."
197,C,C,1,,,,"Which functionality in Wireshark will provide you with percentages for every protocol in the packet capture, ordered by protocol layers? 
A. Conversations 
B.Endpoints 
C.Protocol hierarchy 
D.Statistics view","The correct answer is C.
 While conversations and endpoints are statistics you can get from Wireshark, the protocol hierarchy view shows a layered look at all the protocols in the capture, showing percentages for all of the protocols."
198,D,D,1,,,,"Which program would you use if you wanted to only print specific fields from the captured packet? 
A. fielddump 
B.tcpdump 
C.wiredump 
D.tshark","The correct answer is D.
 While tcpdump and tshark can both be used to capture packets, tshark gives you the ability to specify which fields you want to output. The other two options don’t exist."
199,C,C,1,,,,"The following shows a time stamp. What does the time of this message reflect? 630 41.897644 192.168.86.210 239.255.255.250 SSDP 750 NOTIFY * HTTP/1.1 [ETHERNET FRAME CHECK SEQUENCE INCORRECT] 
A. The time since 1970 
B.The time of day 
C.The time since packet start 
D.There is no time in the summary","The correct answer is C.
 By default, Wireshark shows a relative time since the start of the packet capture. You can change the field to show absolute time, such as the time of day or the time since 1970 (epoch time). However, that’s not what is shown."
200,D,D,1,,,,"What protocol is being used in the frame listed in this summary? 719 42.691135 157.240.19.26 192.168.86.26 TCP 1464 → 61618 [ACK] Seq=4361 Ack=1276 Win=31232 Len=1398 TSval=3725556941 TSecr=1266252437 [TCP segment of a reassembled PDU] 443 
A. TLS 
B.UDP 
C.IP 
D.TCP","The correct answer is D.
 After the frame number, time, source IP, and destination IP is the protocol. This frame shows TCP is the protocol in use."
201,C,C,1,,,,"What program could be used to perform spoofing attacks and also supports plug-ins? 
A. arpspoof 
B.fragroute 
C.Ettercap 
D.sslstrip","The correct answer is C.
 arpspoof and Ettercap can both be used to perform ARP spoofing. Ettercap also supports other types of spoofing attacks and plug-ins. Sslstrip is a plug-in supported in Ettercap. Fragroute is a program that does something completely different."
202,C,C,1,,,,"What would you need to do before you could perform a DNS spoof attack? 
A. Set up a port span 
B.Start up Wireshark 
C.ARP spoof 
D.Configure sslstrip","The correct answer is C.
 A DNS spoofing attack requires that the program can see the DNS request in order to respond to it. This means there needs to be an ARP spoof in place so Ettercap (or another tool) can get the traffic on the network to get the DNS request to respond to."
203,A,A,1,,,,"Which command-line parameter would you use to disable name resolutions in tcpdump? 
A. -n 
B.-i 
C.-r 
D.-x","The correct answer is A.
 The -i flag indicates which interface you are going to listen on. The -n flag tells Wireshark to not do name resolution, leaving you with numeric values for the IP address and port number."
204,B,B,1,,,,"Why might you have more endpoints shown at layer 4 than at layer 2? 
A. Layer 4 multiplexes layer 2. 
B.Systems may initiate multiple connections to the same host. 
C.Ports are more numerous than MAC addresses. 
D.The IP addresses dictate the endpoints.","The correct answer is B.
 The number of MAC addresses can be smaller than the number of layer 3 addresses because multiple IP addresses could be associated with a single MAC address if the IP addresses are off network; the MAC address for those would be the gateway’s MAC address. If a system opens multiple connections to the same system, as may happen when rendering a web page, there would be multiple port combinations for the same IP source and destination."
205,A,A,1,,,,"What would you use sslstrip for? 
A. Getting plaintext traffic 
B.Removing all SSL requests 
C.Converting SSL to TLS 
D.Converting TLS to SSL","The correct answer is A.
 Sslstrip is used to get plaintext traffic. It does not remove SSL requests, though it may be used to convert an HTTPS request to an HTTP request. It does not convert SSL to TLS or TLS to SSL, and there would be no particular advantage to either of those tasks."
206,B,B,1,,,,"Why might you have problems with sslstrip? 
A. sslstrip is deprecated. 
B.sslstrip doesn’t work with newer versions of TLS. 
C.sslstrip doesn’t support TLS. 
D.sslstrip only works with Ettercap.","The correct answer is B.
 Sslstrip was released in 2009 and took advantage of problems in SSL. These problems not only existed in SSL but also continued through early versions of TLS. Newer versions of TLS don’t have the same issues, which means sslstrip won’t work with them."
207,A,A,1,,,,"What does the following line mean? Sequence number: 4361 (relative sequence number) 
A. The sequence number shown is not the real sequence number. 
B.The sequence number shown has not been incremented. 
C.The sequence number shown isn’t long enough. 
D.The sequence number shown is the acknowledgment number.","The correct answer is A.
 Wireshark presents a relative sequence number, which means the initial sequence number as far as Wireshark is concerned in presenting it to you is 1. The relative sequence number increments just as the real sequence number does. The real sequence number, which is a very large value, is hidden to make analysis easier."
208,B,B,1,,,,"What can you say about [TCP Segment Len: 35], as provided by Wireshark? 
A. The window size has changed. 
B.Wireshark has inferred this information. 
C.Wireshark extracted this from one of the headers. 
D.Wireshark has additional detail below.","The correct answer is B.
 Anything you see in Wireshark that is in square brackets [] is something Wireshark has calculated or inferred. It is not something that has been extracted directly from the packet capture. Wireshark is helping with the packet analysis."
209,C,C,1,,,,"What problem does port spanning overcome? 
A. Switches don’t support layer 3. 
B.Switches aggregate ports. 
C.Switches filter traffic. 
D.Switches are unreliable.","The correct answer is C.
 Switches filter traffic by only sending traffic destined for the MAC address associated with the port to which the system that owns the MAC address is attached. Switches are reliable. They don’t support layer 3 as switches, though there are such things as multilayer switches that include routing functionality. Either way, that’s not something that port spanning overcomes. Switches may aggregate ports, but port spanning doesn’t have anything to do with that."
210,B,B,1,,,,"What is the /etc/ettercap/etter.dns file used for? 
A. Enabling firewall rules for Ettercap 
B.Configuring hostnames to IP addresses 
C.Setting up mail for Ettercap 
D.Disabling ARP spoofing in Ettercap","The correct answer is B.
 The ipchains/iptables command to turn on redirection for Ettercap is done in a different file. In the etter.dns file is the mapping of hostnames to IP addresses as well as other DNS resource records."
211,A,A,1,,,,"You get a phone call from someone telling you they are from the IRS and they are sending the police to your house now to arrest you unless you provide a method of payment imme- diately. What tactic is the caller using? 
A. Pretexting 
B.Biometrics 
C.Smishing 
D.Rogue access","The correct answer is A.
 Biometrics is the use of a physical attribute to provide authentication. Smishing is using short message service (SMS/texting) to gather information from people. Rogue access isn’t really anything. Pretexting is coming up with a believable story that you can use when trying to perform a social engineering attack on someone."
212,C,C,1,,,,"You are working on a red-team engagement. Your team leader has asked you to use baiting as a way to get in. What are you being asked to do? 
A. Make phone calls 
B.Clone a website 
C.Leave USB sticks around 
D.Spoof an RFID ID","The correct answer is C.
 Baiting is leaving a lure out in order to gather targets. You could use USB sticks or CDs around as bait if they had software on them that would run and “infect” the target system in a way that would give you control over them. While all of the other options are related to social engineering, none of them is called baiting."
213,B,B,1,,,,"Which of the social engineering principles is in use when you see a line of people at a ven- dor booth at a security conference waiting to grab free USB sticks and CDs? 
A. Reciprocity 
B.Social proof 
C.Authority 
D.Scarcity","The correct answer is B.
 Social proof is in use when it appears to be okay to engage in a behavior because you see others engaging in it. When people see a line of others waiting to grab USB sticks, in spite of knowing they shouldn’t trust USB sticks, they may be inclined to lower their defenses. There is no reciprocity or authority here. There may eventually be scarcity, but that’s not what would drive people to stand in line to acquire a potentially dangerous item."
214,D,D,1,,,,"What is a viable approach to protecting against tailgaiting? 
A. Biometrics 
B.Badge access 
C.Phone verification 
D.Man traps","The correct answer is D.
 Biometrics and badge access are forms of physical access control. Phone verification could possibly be used as a way of verifying identity, but it won’t protect against tailgating. A man trap, however, will protect against tailgating because a man trap allows only one person in at a time."
215,B,B,1,,,,"Why would you use wireless social engineering? 
A. To send phishing messages 
B.To gather credentials 
C.To get email addresses 
D.To make phone calls","The correct answer is B.
 Especially in enterprises, there is generally some authentication that happens. This could be in the form of a pre-shared key or a username/password combination. Either way, when you are using social engineering of wireless networks, you are probably attempting to gather credentials to gain access to sites. It’s unlikely you’d use this vector for sending phishing messages or getting email addresses, and it wouldn’t be used to make phone calls."
216,D,D,1,,,,"Which social engineering principle may allow a phony call from the help desk to be effective? 
A. Social proof 
B.Imitation 
C.Scarcity 
D.Authority","The correct answer is D.
 While you might be imitating someone, imitation is not a social engineering principle. Neither social proof nor scarcity are at play in this situation. However, if you are calling from the help desk, you may be considered to be in a position of authority."
217,B,B,1,,,,"Why would you use automated tools for social engineering attacks? 
A. Better control over outcomes 
B.Reduce complexity 
C.Implement social proof 
D.Demonstrate authority","The correct answer is B.
 It’s debatable whether you get better control over outcomes executing your attacks manually. You would not be implementing social proof or demonstrating authority using an automated attack any more than if you did it manually. You would be reducing complexity, though, since doing it manually means you would be setting up and controlling multiple moving pieces. This gets to be complex, and the attack would fail if you didn’t get it just right."
218,A,A,1,,,,"What social engineering vector would you use if you wanted to gain access to a building? 
A. Impersonation 
B.Scarcity 
C.Vishing 
D.Smishing","The correct answer is A.
 Vishing and smishing are non-kinetic approaches to social engineering. Scarcity is not a social engineering vector. Impersonation is a social engineering vector and the one used to gain unauthorized access to a facility."
219,C,C,1,,,,"Which of these would be an example of pretexting? 
A. Web page asking for credentials 
B.A cloned badge 
C.An email from a former co-worker 
D.Rogue wireless access point","The correct answer is C.
 If you sent an email posing as a former co-worker, you could be implementing a couple of different social engineering principles. Because you have a story and a means to collect information fraudulently, you are using pretexting. The other attacks are also social engineering, but they are not pretexting."
220,C,C,1,,,,"What tool could you use to clone a website? 
A. httclone 
B.curl-get 
C.wget 
D.wclone","The correct answer is C.
 wget is the only one of these options that is a legitimate program, and it can be used to clone a website."
221,B,B,1,,,,"How would someone keep a baiting attack from being successful? 
A. Disable Registry cloning. 
B.Disable autorun. 
C.Epoxy external ports. 
D.Don’t browse the Internet.","The correct answer is B.
 While some people do epoxy USB ports to prevent USB sticks from being inserted, it’s not a good approach and wouldn’t necessarily keep a baiting attack from working if the bait is a CD-ROM. Browsing the Internet is common and no longer doing that won’t protect you against baiting. Registry cloning isn’t really a thing in this context. Disabling autorun would keep any malicious software from running automatically from external devices."
222,D,D,1,,,,"What statistic are you more likely to be concerned about when thinking about implement- ing biometrics? 
A. False positive rate 
B.False negative rate 
C.False failure rate 
D.False acceptance rate","The correct answer is D.
 A false acceptance rate measures how often a biometric system allows unauthorized users access to a facility or area. A false failure (or reject) rate is inconvenient, and some organizations may consider that to be an issue, especially if it’s very high. However, a high false accept rate is probably more concerning because you are allowing people who are really unauthorized to have access. The other two are not statistics that are measured; though they correlate to the others, they are not called false positive rate or false negative rate."
223,A,A,1,,,,"Which of these forms of biometrics is least likely to give a high true accept rate while mini- mizing false reject rates? 
A. Voiceprint 
B.Iris scanning 
C.Retinal scanning 
D.Fingerprint scanning","The correct answer is A.
 Voiceprint identification is the least reliable of these options. As a result, it would be the most likely to give you a high false reject rate, which would lower the true accept rate."
224,D,D,1,,,,"What attack can a proximity card be susceptible to? 
A. Tailgating 
B.Phishing 
C.Credential theft 
D.Cloning","The correct answer is D.
 A proximity card could enable tailgating, but it’s not the only thing—a key could enable tailgating as well. Technically, it’s not the card that allows tailgating anyway. It’s the way the doors are configured and implemented. Phishing is unrelated, and technically, credential theft is as well. Proximity cards, particularly if they use RFID tags, are susceptible to cloning."
225,C,C,1,,,,"Which form of biometrics scans a pattern in the area of the eye around the pupil? 
A. Retinal scanning 
B.Fingerprint scanning 
C.Iris scanning 
D.Uvea scanning","The correct answer is C.
 While the retina and the uvea are also parts of the eye, neither of them encloses the pupil and can be used as a means of identification. Fingerprints are not part of the eye."
226,A,A,1,,,,"What would the result of a high false failure rate be? 
A. People having to call security 
B.Unauthorized people being allowed in 
C.Forcing the use of a man trap 
D.Reduction in the use of biometrics","The correct answer is A.
 A false acceptance rate would be allowing unauthorized people in. If you are an authorized person but your biometric scanner isn’t working reliably and rejects you, you may need to call security or someone else to let you into the building. Neither of the other two would be a result of a high false failure rate. They may be solutions to other problems, but not a high false failure rate."
227,B,B,1,,,,"You’ve received a text message from an unknown number that is only five digits long. It doesn’t have any text, just a URL. What might this be an example of? 
A. Vishing 
B.Smishing 
C.Phishing 
D.Impersonation","The correct answer is B.
 Smishing is short message phishing, which means someone is sending a text message, attempting to fraudulently gather information. Vishing is a phone call (voice). Phishing can be an overall term but commonly refers to email. Impersonation is more of a physical approach."
228,A,A,1,,,,"What is an advantage of a phone call over a phishing email? 
A. You are able to go into more detail with pretexting. 
B.Phishing attacks are unreliable. 
C.Not everyone has email but everyone has a phone. 
D.Pretexting only works over the phone.","The correct answer is A.
 Pretexting can work over email just as well as via a phone call. It may be more common for people to have email than a phone, especially a company-owned landline. Phishing attacks are very successful, which is why they are so commonly used. With a phone call, though, you could go into more detail and address questions or concerns as they arise. You could include additional layers that you couldn’t with an email since you could never be sure if your email was read, or deleted, or caught in a filter."
229,B,B,1,,,,"What is the web page you may be presented with when connecting to a wireless access point, especially in a public place? 
A. Credential harvester 
B.Captive portal 
C.Wi-Fi portal 
D.Authentication point","The correct answer is B.
 The captive portal is the page that is opened when you connect to a public access point. None of the other answers are real things."
230,C,C,1,,,,"What tool could you use to generate email attacks as well as wireless attacks? 
A. Meterpreter 
B.wifiphisher 
C.SE Toolkit 
D.Social Automator","The correct answer is C.
 You may end up with a Meterpreter interface to a remote system, but it wouldn’t be used to generate the attacks. wifiphisher is only used for Wi-Fi–based attacks and Social Automator doesn’t exist. The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SE Toolkit) could be used to automate email attacks as well as wireless attacks."
231,D,D,1,,,,"What are the two types of wireless networks? 
A. Star and ring 
B.Bus and hybrid 
C.Infrastructure and hybrid 
D.Infrastructure and ad hoc","The correct answer is D.
 An infrastructure wireless network is one that uses an access point. An ad hoc wireless network is one organized by the participants. These are the two types of wireless networks. Star, ring, bus, and hybrid are all wired topologies."
232,B,B,1,,,,"How many stages are used in the WPA handshake? 
A. Two 
B.Four 
C.Three 
D.One","The correct answer is B.
 There are four stages used in a WPA handshake. This four-stage process is used to derive the key and agree on capabilities."
233,B,B,1,,,,"What mode has to be enabled on a network interface to allow all headers in wireless traffic to be captured? 
A. Promiscuous 
B.Monitor 
C.Radio 
D.Wireless LAN","The correct answer is B.
 Promiscuous mode is used on network interfaces to collect frames that are not destined for the network interface. This is insufficient on a wireless network because the radio headers are not captured. To capture radio headers, monitor mode needs to be enabled in addition to the promiscuous mode that will always be set to get all frames and all information from the frame. Only monitor mode gives the radio headers."
234,C,C,1,,,,"What wireless attack would you use to take a known piece of information in order to be able to decrypt wireless traffic? 
A. Sniffing 
B.Deauthentication 
C.Key reinstallation 
D.Evil twin","The correct answer is C.
 Sniffing can be used to collect information that may be needed to launch wireless attacks. A deauthentication attack can be used to force a station to generate traffic. An evil twin attack uses a rogue access point to pretend to be a legitimate network. In order to decrypt network traffic, you would need the key. One way to get the key is to reuse information from network traffic that generated a known key. This is a key reinstallation attack."
235,C,C,1,,,,"What is the purpose of performing a Bluetooth scan? 
A. Identifying open ports 
B.Identifying available profiles 
C.Identifying endpoints 
D.Identifying vendors","The correct answer is C.
 Bluetooth doesn’t use ports. While profiles are important, you get the profile capabilities during the pairing process. Just performing a scan won’t get you a list of supported profiles. While you should be able to identify vendors as part of the process of running a Bluetooth scan, it’s not the purpose of the scan. The purpose is to identify endpoints and their associated addresses so you can run other attacks on them."
236,B,B,1,,,,"What is the purpose of a deauthentication attack? 
A. Disabling stations 
B.Forcing stations to reauthenticate 
C.Reducing the number of steps in the handshake 
D.Downgrading encryption","The correct answer is B.
 The purpose of a deauthentication attack is to force stations to reauthenticate. This allows the attacker to collect information from the authentication and handshake. This information could be used later to potentially derive the key, as in WEP transmissions. A deauthentication attack doesn’t disable stations. There is no way to reduce the number of steps in a handshake, and downgrading encryption is considerably harder, if it’s possible at all."
237,A,A,1,,,,"What is the policy that allows people to use their own smartphones on the enterprise network? 
A. Bring your own device 
B.Use your own device 
C.Bring your own smart device 
D.Use your own smart device","The correct answer is A.
 Bring your own device (BYOD) is a policy that allows employees to use their own devices on an enterprise network. This opens the door to the potential for attacks from unknown and unexpected devices. None of the other answers are real things."
238,C,C,1,,,,"What part of the encryption process was weak in WEP? 
A. Keying 
B.Diffie-Hellman 
C.Initialization vector 
D.Seeding vector","The correct answer is C.
 The initialization vector is a random value that seeds the key used for encryption and decryption. In WEP, the algorithm specified for the initialization vector yielded non- random, predictable values. While the initialization vector is part of keying, it’s not the keying itself that was weak. Seeding vector is not a real thing, and Diffie-Hellman is a process used to derive and exchange keys securely. It’s not part of WEP."
239,B,B,1,,,,"What is the four-stage handshake used for? 
A. Passing keys 
B.Deriving keys 
C.Encrypting messages 
D.Initialization seeding","The correct answer is B.
 The four-stage handshake is used to authenticate stations against wireless networks. As part of the handshake, encryption keys are generated. Keys are derived on both sides of the transaction rather than being exchanged directly. This is handled during the four-way handshake. Keys are not passed. Messages can’t be encrypted until the four-way handshake is complete and the keys are generated. There is no such thing as initialization seeding."
240,C,C,1,,,,"What is the SSID used for? 
A. Encrypting messages 
B.Providing a MAC address 
C.Identifying a network 
D.Seeding a key","The correct answer is C.
 The service set identifier (SSID) is used to identify a network. It is the name of the network you would select when you were trying to connect to a network. The SSID is not the MAC address, and it has nothing to do with keys or encryption."
241,D,D,1,,,,"What kind of access point is being used in an evil twin attack? 
A. Infrastructure 
B.Ad hoc 
C.WPA 
D.Rogue","The correct answer is D.
 Ad hoc and infrastructure are types of wireless networks. Only infrastructure uses access points, but infrastructure is not a type of access point. WPA is an encryption protocol. A rogue access point, meaning one that isn’t legitimate, is used in an evil twin attack by pretending to be a legitimate access point."
242,B,B,1,,,,"How does an evil twin attack work? 
A. Phishing users for credentials 
B.Spoofing an SSID 
C.Changing an SSID 
D.Injecting four-way handshakes","The correct answer is B.
 An evil twin attack uses an access point masquerading as the point of connection for stations trying to connect to a legitimate wireless network. Stations reach out to make connections to this access point masquerading as another access point. While you may phish for credentials as part of an evil twin attack, credential phishing is not how evil twin attacks work. SSIDs don’t get changed as part of an evil twin attack, meaning no SSID that exists will become another SSID.
 Injecting four-way handshakes won’t do much, since four- way assumes both ends are communicating, so the injection of a full communication stream will get ignored."
243,C,C,1,,,,"What method might you use to successfully get malware onto a mobile device? 
A. Using the Apple Store or Google Play store 
B.Using external storage on an Android 
C.Using a third-party app store 
D.Jailbreaking","The correct answer is C.
 The Apple App Store and the Google Play Store are controlled by Apple and Google. It’s not impossible to get malware onto mobile devices through them, but it’s very difficult because apps get run through a vetting process. While some Android devices will support external storage, it’s not an effective way to get malware onto a smartphone or other mobile device. Jailbreaking can lead to malware being installed, but it’s not the means to get malware onto a mobile device. Third-party app stores can be a good means to get malware onto mobile devices because some third-party app stores don’t vet apps that are submitted."
244,B,B,1,,,,"What would you use a bluebugging attack for? 
A. Identifying Bluetooth devices nearby 
B.Listening to a physical space 
C.Enabling a phone’s camera 
D.Gathering data from a target system","The correct answer is B.
 A bluebugging attack is used to gain access to a smartphone in order to initiate a call out to the attacker’s phone. This allows the attacker to listen to anything happening around the phone owner. Scanning is used to identify Bluetooth devices nearby. There is no particular attack used to enable a phone’s camera. Gathering data from a target device or system is bluesnarfing."
245,A,A,1,,,,"What would a signal range for a Bluetooth device commonly be? 
A. 300 ft. 
B.3,000 ft. 
C.75 ft. 
D.500 ft.","The correct answer is A.
 While there are Bluetooth devices that will transmit much further, a common range is about 300 feet (100 meters) for Bluetooth 4.0."
246,D,D,1,,,,"What tool could you use to enable sniffing on your wireless network to acquire all headers? 
A. Ettercap 
B.Tcpdump 
C.Aircrack-ng 
D.Airmon-ng","The correct answer is D.
 Tcpdump can be used to capture frames/packets. Ettercap is used for captures and spoofing attacks. Neither can capture all headers, including radio headers in a wireless network. The package aircrack-ng includes the program airmon-ng, which can turn on monitor mode on a network interface. The program aircrack-ng itself cannot do that."
247,B,B,1,,,,"Why is bluesnarfing potentially more dangerous than bluejacking from the standpoint of the victim? 
A. Bluejacking sends while bluesnarfing receives. 
B.Bluejacking receives while bluesnarfing sends. 
C.Bluejacking installs keyloggers. 
D.Bluesnarfing installs keyloggers.","The correct answer is B.
 Bluesnarfing is an attack that connects to a Bluetooth device in order to grab data from that device. Bluesnarfing sends data to the attacker. Bluejacking can be used to send information to a Bluetooth device, such as a text message. Neither of these attacks install keyloggers."
248,C,C,1,,,,"What tool would allow you to run an evil twin attack? 
A. Wireshark 
B.Ettercap 
C.Wifiphisher 
D.Aircrack-ng","The correct answer is C.
 Wireshark is used to capture packets/frames from a network. Ettercap is used for spoofing attacks. The program aircrack-ng can be used to crack wireless keys. Wifiphisher, though, can be used to set up an evil twin attack."
249,B,B,1,,,,"What types of authentication are allowed in a WPA-encrypted network? 
A. Handshake and personal 
B.Personal and enterprise 
C.Enterprise and handshake 
D.802.11 and personal","The correct answer is B.
 WPA supports both Personal and Enterprise authentication. Personal authentication makes use of a pre-shared key, while Enterprise authentication uses usernames and passwords to authenticate specific users, providing accounting and access control, meaning we know exactly who has connected to the network."
250,D,D,1,,,,"What wouldn’t you see when you capture wireless traffic that includes radio headers? 
A. Capabilities 
B.Probe requests 
C.SSIDs 
D.Network type","The correct answer is D.
 Radio headers in a wireless network will provide you with the capabilities of the devices, since that’s negotiated during the association process. You will also see probe requests asking what networks are in the area, including specific networks that a station knows about. These requests will include the SSID.
 The responses will also include the SSID.
 You will not get the network type in the headers."
251,B,B,1,,,,"What protocol is used for a Smurf attack? 
A. DNS 
B.ICMP 
C.TCP 
D.SMTP","The correct answer is B.
 While DNS is also used for amplification attacks, Smurf attacks are a result of someone sending ICMP echo requests to the broadcast address of a network. The echo responses would be sent to the address in the source of the request, which would be spoofed. If enough systems respond, the volume of responses can overwhelm the target system."
252,C,C,1,,,,"If you were to see ' or 1=1; in a packet capture, what would you expect was happening? 
A. Cross-site scripting 
B.Command injection 
C.SQL injection 
D.XML external entity injection","The correct answer is C.
 An SQL injection attack makes use of SQL queries, which can include logic that may alter the flow of the application. In the example provided, the intent is to force the result of the SQL query to always return a true. It is quoted the way it is to escape the existing query already in place in the application. None of the other attacks use a syntax that looks like the example."
253,C,C,1,,,,"Which protocol is commonly used for amplification attacks? 
A. TCP 
B.SMTP 
C.DNS 
D.XML","The correct answer is C.
 Because TCP uses a three-way handshake, spoofing like that needed in amplification is very difficult. SMTP also uses TCP. XML is used for data structure and presentation. DNS is often used for modern amplification attacks."
254,A,A,1,,,,"What is the purpose of a SYN flood? 
A. Fill up connection buffers at the operating system 
B.Fill up connection buffers in the web server 
C.Fill up connection buffers at the Application layer 
D.Fill up connection buffers for UDP","The correct answer is A.
 A SYN flood takes advantage of the three-way handshake. A SYN message alone will consume a connection buffer at the operating system. Until the operating system has passed the three-way handshake, the request won’t make it to the web server at the Application layer. SYN is not a header flag used with UDP."
255,B,B,1,,,,"How does a slowloris attack work? 
A. Holds open connection buffers at the operating system 
B.Holds open connection buffers at the web server 
C.Holds open connection buffers at the Application layer 
D.Holds open connection buffers for UDP","The correct answer is B.
 A slowloris attack is used to hold open connection buffers at the web server. Enough of these requests will consume all of the possible connections for the web server. The Application layer doesn’t factor in here because there are no connection buffers at the Application layer. Web servers don’t use UDP for HTTP requests, and slowloris is an attack against a web server."
256,C,C,1,,,,"What would be the result of sending the string AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA into a variable that has been allocated space for 8 bytes? 
A. Heap spraying 
B.SQL injection 
C.Buffer overflow 
D.Slowloris attack","The correct answer is C.
 Heap spraying uses dynamically allocated space to store attack code. A slowloris attack is used to hold open web server connection buffers. An SQL injection will be used to inject SQL queries to the database server. A buffer overflow sends more data than space has been allocated for into the application."
257,D,D,1,,,,"What is the target of a cross-site scripting attack? 
A. Web server 
B.Database server 
C.Third-party server 
D.User","The correct answer is D.
 A cross-site scripting attack uses a scripting language to run in the browser. Since the browser is with the user, ultimately the attack targets the user, even if the injection code is stored in a database server."
258,D,D,1,,,,"If you were to see the following in a packet capture, what would you think was happening? <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM ""file:///etc/passwd"" >]> 
A. Cross-site scripting 
B.SQL injection 
C.Command injection 
D.XML external entity injection","The correct answer is D.
 Cross-site scripting attacks usually use JavaScript or perhaps VBScript. SQL injection uses SQL. Command injection uses operating system commands. The fragment shows XML using an external entity. This is, then, an XML external entity injection."
259,B,B,1,,,,"What protection could be used to prevent an SQL injection attack? 
A. Buffer overflows 
B.Input validation 
C.XML filtering 
D.Lateral movement","The correct answer is B.
 SQL injection attacks take data injected from the user/attacker. Any data sent in from a user should always be validated before being acted on. Nothing coming in from a user should be trusted. None of the other answers could be used to prevent an SQL injection attack."
260,A,A,1,,,,"What security element would be a crucial part of a defense in depth network design? 
A. Firewall 
B.SIEM 
C.Web application firewall 
D.Log management system","The correct answer is A.
 A defense in depth network design makes use of multiple prevention layers to make breaching the inside of the network quite a bit harder. A SIEM is used to collect and correlate intelligence and log data. A web application firewall protects against Application layer attacks. A log management system is just what it says. A firewall, though, is commonly used in a defense in depth network design."
261,A,A,1,,,,"What does a defense in breadth approach add? 
A. Consideration for a broader range of attacks 
B.Protection against SQL injection 
C.Buffer overflow protection 
D.Heap spraying protection","The correct answer is A.
 Defense in breadth starts with defense in depth and takes a broader range of attack strategies into consideration. Defense in breadth doesn’t necessarily protect against SQL injection and probably doesn’t protect against buffer overflows or heap spraying attacks. Those protections may possibly be achieved, but ultimately defense in breadth would achieve them by taking a broader range of attacks into consideration."
262,C,C,1,,,,"What attack injects code into dynamically allocated memory? 
A. Buffer overflow 
B.Cross-site scripting 
C.Heap spraying 
D.Slowloris","The correct answer is C.
 A buffer overflow attack is an attack against data in the stack, which is known about at compile time and, as a result, is not dynamic. Cross-site scripting attacks and slowloris attacks don’t inject code into memory. A heap spraying attack, though, injects code into the heap, which is where dynamically allocated memory is taken from."
263,C,C,1,,,,"If you were to see the following in a packet capture, what attack would you expect is happening? %3Cscript%3Ealert('wubble');%3C/script%3E 
A. SQL injection 
B.Command injection 
C.Cross-site scripting 
D.Buffer overflow","The correct answer is C.
 A buffer overflow takes an excess amount of data and tries to store it into a memory location that can’t accommodate it. An SQL injection attack uses SQL. Command injection attacks use operating system commands. A cross-site scripting attack uses a scripting language such as JavaScript or VBScript. The script is injected using a <script> HTML tag, and the %3C is a way of encoding < while %3E is a way of encoding >. This means %3Cscript%3E would be decoded to <script>."
264,B,B,1,,,,"What has been done to the following string? %3Cscript%3Ealert('wubble');%3C/script%3E 
A. Base64 encoding 
B.URL encoding 
C.Encryption 
D.Cryptographic hashing","The correct answer is B.
 Base64 encoding takes non-printable characters and encodes them in a way that they can be rendered in text. Encryption would generally render text unreadable to people. A cryptographic hash is a way of generating a fixed-length value. URL encoding takes text and uses hexadecimal values to represent the characters. This is text that has been converted into hexadecimal so they can be used in a URL."
265,D,D,1,,,,"What technique does a slow read attack use? 
A. Small HTTP header requests 
B.Small HTTP body requests 
C.Small HTTP POST requests 
D.Small file retrieval requests","The correct answer is D.
 A slowloris attack uses small HTTP requests to hold open a web server’s available connections. There are attacks that use body requests in a slow fashion. However, a slow read attack tries to download"
266,D,D,1,,,,"What element could be used to facilitate log collection, aggregation, and correlation? 
A. Log manager 
B.Firewall 
C.IDS 
D.SIEM","The correct answer is D.
 While a firewall and an IDS will generate logs, they don’t collect them. A log manager will collect logs and perhaps aggregate them, but it probably doesn’t correlate log messages. A SIEM, though, will consume logs, aggregate them, and correlate them."
267,A,A,1,,,,"What is the target of a command injection attack? 
A. Operating system 
B.Web server 
C.Database server 
D.User","The correct answer is A.
 A command injection sends operating system commands into a web application so they can be run by the operating system. The web server (meaning the web server application) is not the target of the command injection, nor is the database server or the user."
268,C,C,1,,,,"What would the Low Orbit Ion Cannon be used for? 
A. SQL injection attacks 
B.Log management 
C.Denial of service attacks 
D.Buffer overflows","The correct answer is C.
 The Low Orbit Ion Cannon is a .NET-based application used to launch denial of service attacks. It is not used for log management or SQL injection attacks, nor is it used for buffer overflows."
269,B,B,1,,,,"What could you use to inform a defensive strategy? 
A. SIEM output 
B.Attack life cycle 
C.Logs 
D.Intrusion detection system","The correct answer is B.
 SIEM output is useful and may have some value in understanding current attacks. The same is true with logs and intrusion detection systems. However, the attack life cycle is a structured way to understand how attacks happen in order to better inform a defensive strategy so controls can be implemented for each of the phases of the attack."
270,C,C,1,,,,"What information does a buffer overflow intend to control? 
A. Stack pointer 
B.Frame pointer 
C.Instruction pointer 
D.Buffer pointer","The correct answer is C.
 The stack pointer indicates where the stack is in memory. The frame pointer indicates which part of the stack is being used for the current frame. There is no buffer pointer from the perspective of the operating system, though applications do use pointers and they do point to buffers. An instruction pointer tells the processor where the next instruction to be executed is. Controlling this piece of information can allow the attacker to control the execution flow of the program."
271,C,C,1,,,,"With a rotation of 4, what does erwaiv decrypt to? 
A. waive 
B.wave 
C.answer 
D.decrypt","The correct answer is C.
 This is a rotation cipher with a key of 4. When you rotate the alphabet by 4, you end up with e = a, r = n, w = s, and so on. In addition to not being the right decryption, none of the others have the correct number of letters. In a substitution cipher like a rotation cipher, you will always have the same number of letters in the output as you do in the input."
272,B,B,1,,,,"What do you call a message before it is encrypted? 
A. Text 
B.Plain text 
C.Bare words 
D.Bare text","The correct answer is B.
 In cryptography, any data or message that is in an unencrypted state is called plaintext. The output from a cryptographic process is ciphertext. While you may have text as input to an encryption process, the word text would be ambiguous in this context. The other two are unrelated to cryptography."
273,C,C,1,,,,"What does PGP use to verify identity? 
A. Central authority 
B.Web of users 
C.Web of trust 
D.Central trust authority","The correct answer is C.
 Where certificate authorities use a centralized mechanism for verification of users or certificate subjects, PGP uses a decentralized model. PGP calls this a web of trust, where individual users sign keys that belong to other people to validate that they are who they say they are. All of the other answers are made-up terms."
274,A,A,1,,,,"What principle is used to demonstrate that a signed message came from the owner of the key that signed it? 
A. Non-repudiation 
B.Non-verifiability 
C.Integrity 
D.Authority","The correct answer is A.
 Integrity is part of the CIA triad but isn’t the principle that ties a signed message back to the subject of the signing certificate. Non-verifiability is nonsense, and authority isn’t relevant here. Instead, non-repudiation means someone can’t say they didn’t send a message if it was signed with their key. This assumes the key was in their possession and password protected, meaning no one else could use it."
275,C,C,1,,,,"What is Diffie-Hellman used for? 
A. Key management 
B.Key isolation 
C.Key exchange 
D.Key revocation","The correct answer is C.
 Certificates can be revoked but that’s not what Diffie-Hellman is used for. Key management is a much broader topic than key exchange, which is what Diffie-Hellman is used for. It is a process that allows two parties to an encrypted conversation to mutually derive the same key starting with the same base value."
276,D,D,1,,,,"How did 3DES improve on DES? 
A. Made the key longer 
B.Used two keys 
C.Changed algorithms 
D.Used three keys","The correct answer is D.
 3DES, or Triple DES, uses three keys. The first key is used to encrypt the plaintext. The second key is used to decrypt the ciphertext resulting from the first round of encryption. Finally, the third key is used to encrypt the ciphertext that resulted from the decryption with the second key. The key wasn’t made longer because the 168 bits used in 3DES aren’t used in a single key. The underlying DES algorithm is still used."
277,A,A,1,,,,"What improvement does elliptic curve cryptography make? 
A. Smaller keys improve speed 
B.Algorithm is more complex 
C.Doesn’t use factoring, which is better 
D.Longer keys","The correct answer is A.
 Algorithms used for elliptic curve cryptography are not more complex, necessarily. While they don’t use factoring, that fact alone doesn’t necessarily make the algorithms better. Instead, elliptic curve cryptography relies on the assumption that determining a discrete logarithm of a point on an elliptic curve can’t be computed in a consistent way. The keys that result from elliptic key cryptography are actually smaller than those that result from factoring with large prime numbers."
278,B,B,1,,,,"What is it called when two different data sets yield the same cryptographic hash? 
A. Paradox 
B.Collision 
C.Crash 
D.Unrealistic","The correct answer is B.
 When two different data sets yield the same cryptographic hash, it is called a collision. It relates to a mathematical problem called the birthday paradox, but two values being the same is not a paradox. It’s also not unrealistic, nor is it a crash."
279,C,C,1,,,,"Which of the following terms can be used in a description of asymmetric key encryption? 
A. Private key 
B.Multifactor 
C.Public key 
D.Single factor","The correct answer is C.
 Asymmetric key cryptography uses two related keys. One key is used for encryption and one is used for decryption. These keys are referred to as the public and private key. Because it’s the public key that is used to encrypt messages to the owner of the paired private key, this type of encryption is commonly referred to as public key cryptography. It is neither single factor nor multifactor since it’s not authentication."
280,C,C,1,,,,"If Alice were to send an email to Bob, what key would she use to encrypt the message? 
A. PGP key 
B.Private key 
C.Public key 
D.Symmetric key","The correct answer is C.
 Public key cryptography works because the public key can be provided to anyone. The only thing you can do with the public key is encrypt a message that could be decrypted by the matched private key. This process uses asymmetric encryption, so it’s not a symmetric key. The private key has to be with the owner of the key and protected. If that key gets out, any messages encrypted to the owner by the public key could be decrypted. PGP uses public/private keys and does not have its own type of key."
281,D,D,1,,,,"What property allows you to trust someone trusted by a certificate authority you trust? 
A. Commutative property 
B.Associative property 
C.Communicative property 
D.Transitive property","The correct answer is D.
 What this says is that if A trusts B and B trusts C, then A can trust C.
 This is an application of the transitive property. The commutative and associative properties are both also mathematical principles. There is no such thing as a communicative property."
282,A,A,1,,,,"Why is symmetric key encryption typically used over asymmetric key encryption? 
A. It’s faster. 
B.It’s more secure. 
C.It’s easier to implement. 
D.It isn’t encumbered with patents.","The correct answer is A.
 Symmetric key encryption is generally used instead of asymmetric key encryption because symmetric key encryption uses shorter keys and fewer resources, resulting in shorter times for encryption and decryption. This does not make it more secure, even if that word were to be defined in this context. Symmetric key is not easier to implement and asymmetric key is not encumbered with patents, which is why C and D are wrong."
283,B,B,1,,,,"What is it called when both symmetric and asymmetric keys are used? 
A. Fast cryptosystem 
B.Hybrid cryptosystem 
C.Super-symmetric cryptosystem 
D.Dual key cryptosystem","The correct answer is B.
 When both symmetric and asymmetric keys are used, typically where the asymmetric key is used to protect the symmetric key, it is called a hybrid cryptosystem. The other options don’t exist."
284,D,D,1,,,,"What is MD5 or SHA-1 commonly used for in cryptography? 
A. Media access control (MAC) 
B.Machine authentication code (MAC) 
C.Message access code (MAC) 
D.Message authentication code (MAC)","The correct answer is D.
 Media access control (MAC) is an address attached to physical network interfaces. The correct answer is message authentication code because SHA-1 and MD-5 are used as message authentication codes to ensure that a message has not been tampered with. This means it is being authenticated."
285,B,B,1,,,,"What type of encryption does PGP use? 
A. Symmetric key 
B.Asymmetric key 
C.Trusted key 
D.Web key","The correct answer is B.
 PGP uses public and private keys. The public key is stored in a public place like a key repository. Since there are two keys, PGP uses asymmetric key encryption, sometimes known as public key encryption."
286,B,B,1,,,,"Which of the security triad properties does the Biba security model relate to? 
A. Confidentiality 
B.Integrity 
C.Availability 
D.All of them","The correct answer is B.
 The Biba security model covers data integrity. While other models cover confidentiality, none of them cover availability."
287,D,D,1,,,,"How many tiers are there in an n-tier application design? 
A. Two 
B.Three 
C.Four 
D.Depends on the application","The correct answer is D.
 An n-tier application, sometimes called a multitier application, can have as many tiers as necessary. While you may think there are three, there could be more tiers than that, depending on how the application is designed."
288,C,C,1,,,,"What type of database may JSON be most likely to represent? 
A. Relational 
B.SQL 
C.Key-value 
D.Document-based","The correct answer is C.
 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) uses keys and values to store data. While you could theoretically represent a relational database in JSON, it wouldn’t be the most efficient. SQL is a language used to query relational databases, and document-based databases may be more likely to use other document types to store data."
289,C,C,1,,,,"How many functions are specified by NIST’s cybersecurity framework? 
A. None 
B.Three 
C.Five 
D.Four","The correct answer is C.
 The NIST cybersecurity framework specifies five functions: identify, protect, detect, response, recover."
290,C,C,1,,,,"How many steps in the ISO 27001 cycle? 
A. Two 
B.Three 
C.Four 
D.Five","The correct answer is C.
 The ISO 27001 specification takes a different approach than NIST’s cybersecurity framework. ISO 27001 specifies Plan, Do, Act, Check, which is four steps."
291,A,A,1,,,,"What is the highest level of classification used by the U.S. government? 
A. Top secret 
B.Confidential 
C.Restricted 
D.Eyes only","The correct answer is A.
 The highest level of classification used by the US government is top secret. Confidential and restricted are lower levels, and eyes only is not a classification used by the U.S. government."
292,D,D,1,,,,"Which of these is microservices a specific implementation of? 
A. Service object architecture 
B.Micro Channel architecture 
C.Micro services architecture 
D.Service-oriented architecture","The correct answer is D.
 Micro Channel architecture is a specification for peripherals to interact with hardware systems that was proposed and implemented by IBM in the 1990s. Service-oriented architecture is an older concept that has been revived, to a degree, by microservices. The other answers are not things that exist."
293,C,C,1,,,,"What is an application referred to if it is only using AWS Lambda functions? 
A. Service-oriented 
B.Virtualized 
C.Serverless 
D.Infrastructure as a service","The correct answer is C.
 Infrastructure as a service is a cloud-based offering where companies may just acquire servers they can use for their infrastructure. Service oriented is a way of potentially designing applications. Everything in AWS is virtualized. This leaves serverless. Lambda functions don’t require the provisioning of servers to support them. All processing of the function and its data is handled by AWS infrastructure."
294,C,C,1,,,,"What does the Clark-Wilson model use to refer to objects? 
A. UTI and CDI 
B.CDI and CTI 
C.UDI and CDI 
D.UTI and UDI","The correct answer is C.
 The Clark-Wilson Integrity Model specifies Constrained Data Items (CDIs) and Unconstrained Data Items (UDIs) that are used when identifying and implementing rules. The other answers either don’t exist or refer to things that are not related to information security."
295,D,D,1,,,,"What type of application virtualization would you use without going all the way to using a hypervisor? 
A. Emulation 
B.AWS 
C.Paravirtualization 
D.Containers","The correct answer is D.
 Emulation is where applications may be run on a processor they were not compiled for so the operation codes are emulated. AWS is Amazon Web Services, which can offer application virtualization services but is not a type of application virtualization. Paravirtualization is partial virtualization. Containers are a way of isolating applications without using full virtual machines on a hypervisor."
296,A,A,1,,,,"What is the first function specified by NIST in its cybersecurity framework? 
A. Identify 
B.Protect 
C.Risk Management 
D.Defend","The correct answer is A.
 The Five Functions designated by NIST are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. You can’t do any of the other functions until you have been through Identify, which defines business needs and essential assets for the business."
297,D,D,1,,,,"What is a common middle tier in an n-tier application design? 
A. Web server 
B.Database server 
C.Logic server 
D.Application server","The correct answer is D.
 Commonly, you will see the following in an n-tier application design as core features: browser, application server, database server. There may also be security functions and load balancers as well as a web server in front of the application server. When you focus just on the core, though, the application server is in the middle of the architecture."
298,B,B,1,,,,"What is a common open-source relational database server that may be used in web applications? 
A. MongoDB 
B.MySQL 
C.SQL 
D.Oracle","The correct answer is B.
 MongoDB is a NoSQL server that is not relational. SQL Server is ambiguous but could refer to Microsoft SQL Server, which is not open-source. Oracle is a company that owns relational database servers, including MySQL, but only MySQL is open-source."
299,C,C,1,,,,"Which of the following is true about the Bell-LaPadula Simple Security Property? 
A. A subject cannot write up to an object. 
B.A subject cannot write down to an object. 
C.A subject cannot read up to an object. 
D.A subject cannot read down to an object.","The correct answer is C.
 The Bell-LaPadula Simple Security Property says a subject cannot read an object at a higher level than the subject. None of the other answers are correct."
300,D,D,1,,,,"What are the phases of the ISO 27001 cycle? 
A. Plan, Identify, Act, Detect 
B.Plan, Detect, Act, Do 
C.Act, Do, Identify, Play 
D.Plan, Do, Check, Act","The correct answer is D.
 Some of the answers here mingle the five functions from NIST with the phases of the ISO 27001 cycle. The only option that has only ISO 27001 phases is D, and those are Plan, Do, Check, and Act."
